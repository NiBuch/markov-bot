@#$ $#@ The people that usually frequent these threads tend to not be online at this time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such is the neet lifestyle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lotus flower? #$%
@#$ $#@ Buddhism again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the games, being about eastern culture, have to do something with Buddhism in one way or another. #$%
@#$ $#@ but I just woke up #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, it doesn't HAVE to be Buddhist to use Buddhist imagery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Much like how Minamitsu is a Buddhist but you would NEVER guess that from just looking at her. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I mean, neets sleep all day and wake up at night/in the evening. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's almost 7PM here on the east coast. #$%
@#$ $#@ The demos are always harder than the full game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a NEET and I sleep all night and wake up in the morning. #$%
@#$ $#@ My schedule changes since I sleep for about 10 hours and am awake for about 18. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am technically awake all 24 hours in a single week. #$%
@#$ $#@ What nationality is she again? #$%
@#$ $#@ westaboo japanese? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is she the reason why some people say that Yukari is a gaijin? #$%
@#$ $#@ I seriously wonder if it's the same guy all time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you join us, anon~kun! #$%
@#$ $#@ good thing i made more #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks again, anon! #$%
@#$ $#@ no prob #$%
@#$ $#@ flappy flappy #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there any other final bosses you've done or are working on? #$%
@#$ $#@ i would do more but i only have the sprites for 11 12 14 and 15 #$%
@#$ $#@ That's fine, just know that we all appreciate you for trying and getting it done. #$%
@#$ $#@ the qt demon girl from an ending in mystic square #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't remember #$%
@#$ $#@ Useless bucket girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone from Highly Responsive to Prayers, and anyone from Phantasmagoria of Dim. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dream that isn't Chiyuri and Yumemi. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shingyoku, Sariel and Konngara are pretty memorable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't say the same for the rest of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're favourite 2hu #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be Momiji if she didn't become a meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only ZUN forgot #$%
@#$ $#@ Sariel is memorable for her theme, along with being a creepy looking angel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Konngara has a pretty crazy design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Shingyoku that one floating torso that switches between genders? #$%
@#$ $#@ Canon Momiji is badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Secondary Momiji is a useless moeblob. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tertiary Momiji is a shitty /s4s/ meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ this one #$%
@#$ $#@ All her fans are tertiaries or secondaries. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres absolutely no canon discussion of her ever cause none of her fans know anything about her at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come on now anon #$%
@#$ $#@ But I like red Yuuka #$%
@#$ $#@ What about this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do these work? #$%
@#$ $#@ The worst kind of fate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine people liking you without knowing anything about you, actually demeaning your actual character into a simple-minded, dog-thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still have yet to read the changelog in English. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was waiting for the part where he eventually gets bored. #$%
@#$ $#@ post more doll raymoo #$%
@#$ $#@ I pity those who cannot enjoy the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're really fun! #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't figure out how that new feature in the network menu works, wonder what it does #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that, post doll Marisa. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really like them all #$%
@#$ $#@ Stage 2 has a pretty cool theme I think #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't #$%
@#$ $#@ no way, dude #$%
@#$ $#@ what the fuck even is stage 1 and 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ How is that related to this thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ hold shift to focus #$%
@#$ $#@ Press x to bomb #$%
@#$ $#@ Get familiar with each of the games' individual gimmicks and scoring systems. #$%
@#$ $#@ It took me a while to beat even a simple game like Ten Desires until I found out how the trance system works. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can but might end leaving out of the blue #$%
@#$ $#@ It's pretty good. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is a decent fighter, now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, forget that, something keeps happening #$%
@#$ $#@ decent compared to what. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's much better now than before the patch, even if she is still low tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought there weren't any computers at the Myouren Temple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to bed, Miko. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both sides are shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally breasts. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is female. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shinto 4 lyfe #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't we all just get along? #$%
@#$ $#@ i don't #$%
@#$ $#@ A weenus peenus #$%
@#$ $#@ Moriya and Hakurei shrines get along fine, those guys need to as well #$%
@#$ $#@ MoF endings sure look like they turned out fine, or did you never play the games anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, Okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you even read Forbidden Scrollery? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that the one where she tries to build her own little shrine and Kanako comes over to call it shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ I already knew that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Balance change is a misleading phrase, OP should have said change to resource mechanics or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, why you ask me that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm OP and I do regret that choice of words. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything turned out fine though #$%
@#$ $#@ But it shows that Reimu is still pissed about Moriyas jewery #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have to reply. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like you didn't have to say you were going to cosplay, or draw so much attention to yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never played it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not much of a trading card game, feels more like a normal card game with a few TCG elements. #$%
@#$ $#@ All friends here #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to believe that if Futo ever becomes playable in a shump she will have a shoottype like that but with plates #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is raymoo cry? #$%
@#$ $#@ Speak for yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hormones are a wonderful thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn I wish it were possible #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't really fit tho, nay #$%
@#$ $#@ but do hormones give you spell cards #$%
@#$ $#@ This picture makes no sense #$%
@#$ $#@ definite yay #$%
@#$ $#@ Guardian of cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like what? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not a three-headed cat, you liar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stealing bikes. #$%
@#$ $#@ sponge bobu! #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rumble temple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rumble Temple sounds like the composer had a much different idea for what kind of character Kasen is than ZUN did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Battlefield is better #$%
@#$ $#@ Let's just say you type like you talk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sanae was a mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Answer the question #$%
@#$ $#@ Ahaha, go fuck yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make me #$%
@#$ $#@ both are really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Congrats, fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now go for Yukari #$%
@#$ $#@ Cute picture #$%
@#$ $#@ Doremy, since Yuugi and Kagerou have only one spellcard that can cause trouble Mt Ooe and Sirius respectevely, Doremy has that nasty last spellcard and the omnidiretional lasers #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll make you when I pull your rectum inside-out #$%
@#$ $#@ watch out for that edge anon, you might cut yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ I CUTTED MYSELF WHEN I ACESNEDDED FROM THE DARKNES. #$%
@#$ $#@ Touhou will become forgotten and Gensokyo will become a real fantasy in all senses. #$%
@#$ $#@ The border will close for ever, we will forget everything about the touhou project and all the related media will dissapear, simple as that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad you like my wife! #$%
@#$ $#@ B-but I don't want to forget #$%
@#$ $#@ Doremy theme felt really uprising and epic not the intro ofc, but yes, Shimyoumaru theme is also feels way more intense #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, didn't know that picture was actually a reference to something #$%
@#$ $#@ Its his game, let him do what he wants. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe he finds it fun to do the art for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you ever consider that? #$%
@#$ $#@ The art is cute #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, I love how his art looks, it's cute in its own way. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would rather her sit on my lap so I can feel her wings and hair brushing up against me #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly because he started almost alone, he noticed that the fans liked his odd style and probably pressumed that it is better to do it like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Presumably because he's always made it all by himself, and wants to continue making it all by himself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same reason he doesn't start selling the games on Steam, he doesn't want to be anything other than a small indie dev at an independently published convention. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't decide if that makes him respectable or a hipster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I having deja-vu? #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't want to sell the games on Steam because he hates westerners as much as he hates Youmu. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's pretty much relative anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Koakuma, you're not even important. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some are, some not #$%
@#$ $#@ Byakuren was always shit and midlife crisis Byakuren is even worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd just hope to get to see Alice appear again #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, the "fuck you" Alice please. #$%
@#$ $#@ You guys are getting unbearable #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Alice, bring back the captain. #$%
@#$ $#@ At this point I've learned to accept that my favorite 2hu will never ever appear again out of incredibly rare cameos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigger you what? #$%
@#$ $#@ She doesnt even get that much fanart anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ same, i know she's not getting too far but i like her the way she is #$%
@#$ $#@ Being a Marisafag is a pretty good feel tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Somewhere, in a far away land, a dullahan girl cries because of you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just walk away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't come back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just walk away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play DDC right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come back when you have 1cc'd it at least on normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should dress as Sekibanki and take pictures. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad I got to stick it to all the protag faggots this time #$%
@#$ $#@ only primaries deserve those kind of content #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask nicely and I might. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of faggot likes the protagonists? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't hate them I just hate their fans because they'll always have the happiness of seeing them come back for the next game #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont hate the protagonists, I just hate Marisafags cause they're obnoxious as hell and call every other 2hu shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry anon the other one, or I might have the wrong picture #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you please make a gif of Sumireko's victory animation that includes her cellphone's flash, sir? #$%
@#$ $#@ as same as Marisa #$%
@#$ $#@ Please teach me your ways #$%
@#$ $#@ Encouraging a secondary to stay a secondary isn't a good deed #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna make eggs with yamame #$%
@#$ $#@ My good deed for today is to tell you to fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't become a primary, you born wanting to become a primary on some subjects, a secondary will always stay as a secondary #$%
@#$ $#@ Either learn to be able to stay in human or youkai form and git gud with them. #$%

@#$ $#@ One exists? #$%
@#$ $#@ Turbo Granny #$%
@#$ $#@ Wiser words have never been spoken in these threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ best 2hu #$%
@#$ $#@ Byakuren got her ass nerfed in the new ULiL patch, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ delete savegame #$%
@#$ $#@ rollan for Turbo Granny #$%
@#$ $#@ Youkai Jesus #$%
@#$ $#@ or don't let your dreams be Doremy because you will be fucked up #$%
@#$ $#@ This is fine #$%
@#$ $#@ The lord has spoken! #$%
@#$ $#@ Hat and dress are too silly #$%
@#$ $#@ omfg, what if Meiling actually knew about Doremy all these years and didn't say anything because she thought it was a persistent dream dissorder and thus wasn't real at all, holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ringo is the best lolkhu #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give it time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Drawing takes a little bit of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have the complete of these of pics of remilia? #$%
@#$ $#@ Balance in tone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe, but there's no way I'm going to looking for them in my files. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dumping what I have. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember how many were there? #$%
@#$ $#@ Post your scores, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post yours first you fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ And that's it, I'm sure there were more, but I'm far too lazy to search for them all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since you got some out of the way I'll go ahead and post the rest of mine. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know how japs minds got fucked up after the bombing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Must be te same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mad with love #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually nah, fuck that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make the Marisa's Mansion that ZUN deceived us with #$%
@#$ $#@ Myouren cementery is spookier than SDM #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure the Myouren temple is a really fucking exciting place for a game that takes place in a mansion. #$%
@#$ $#@ That poster was really cool, it's a shame that ULiL didn't lived up to the expectations. #$%
@#$ $#@ That ULiL poster was the first thing I though of when I read that post. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well there'd have to be a story that made enough sense as to use the youkai maids in there or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe they go crazy or Sakuya has had enough of their shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ interesting concept #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, nobody expected anything about it, my bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ What wrong with Marisa? #$%
@#$ $#@ having Sumireko as a waifu makes you a tumblrfag as a bonus #$%
@#$ $#@ SDM is so overrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make it the Prismriver Manor instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing really, but all shot types in SA suck other than Reimu A. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice idea #$%
@#$ $#@ Be original instead #$%
@#$ $#@ Marisa shoot types seem fine you just need to get hang of it #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, there's no point in being hipsters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just giving the guy ideas because seems he'd like that as a setting. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I were to give any ideas, it'd be that the character would go to various places for each scary 2hu they'd be looking for, be it the mansion, bamboo forest or the graveyard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The alice one gives loads of bombs at least #$%
@#$ $#@ If I wanted to be original I wouldn't make a touhou game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'd think it'd be Sanae, but Youmu is also green and she's afraid of any ghost besides Yuyuko for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can make a 2hu game and still put your own spin to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can use the SDM and put my own spin on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ TRIPS SPEAK THE TRUTH #$%
@#$ $#@ And be boring as fuck using overused characters #$%
@#$ $#@ Let me guess, it would be totally fine if it was whatever obscure character that you happen to like in whatever obscure place nobody talks about that you like. #$%
@#$ $#@ All SA bombs are shit except Reimu A #$%
@#$ $#@ what's the difference between Allah and YHVH? #$%
@#$ $#@ Touhou has a fuckton of characters, but you insist on using the same ~10 characters that everyone knows #$%
@#$ $#@ Reimu's B bomb is good if you know how to use it #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's boring to see the same characters over and over again #$%
@#$ $#@ And who made you the judicator of what was boring and not? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off and let him make the game as he intends to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad fag #$%
@#$ $#@ But Prismriver Mansion does make the most sense than SDM or Chireiden, and its a place that's very underdeveloped so you have a lot of creative freedom with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only really listen to arranges of the music. #$%
@#$ $#@ And play through Imperishable Night once every 2 years on easy modo so I don't feel so much of a secondaryfag. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't have a single 2hu merchandise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably going to try some time in the future to buy one of the game CDs at the very least, mostly only to feel at peace with myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ There aren't even cons near the shithole I live at, so I'll likely just get it through internet. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not your fault well, i don't know, but you got to live with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ this kills the fumo #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone's mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ stop picking memehus #$%
@#$ $#@ A good girl! #$%
@#$ $#@ No I don't. #$%
@#$ $#@ An operator. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christian imageboard #$%
@#$ $#@ not my fault little sisters are so superior #$%
@#$ $#@ I want moonman to join up with the prismrivers and be a vocalist #$%
@#$ $#@ a fumo tag is like its virgnity #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't make this #$%
@#$ $#@ Which one? #$%
@#$ $#@ Vampire lolis are a miracle of the universe anon, don't ever let them take that from you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop giving him attention. #$%
@#$ $#@ A kappa #$%
@#$ $#@ He's obviously talking about San Andreas, dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hartmann's Youkai Girl &gt; UN Owen was her? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't want a plushie, I'm not a little girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, those people who tend to visit touhou threads on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much do fumos typically cost? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've always wanted one or two, at least a Remilia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Roughly $40 shipped from amiami. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's all cosplayers though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Before thread dies, what's the best way to get them from Japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not the same guy, but I've never bought anything from there. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it was up to me, we'd be talking about our favorite characters, doujins, music, and games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never got this image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does she stutter like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ She's the one making the threat. #$%
@#$ $#@ But you hit her with a shovel anon, that's why #$%
@#$ $#@ She just got hit with a shovel almost 10 times nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks fine to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Touhou cosplays are the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ The cancolle thread have literally nothing to disscuss other than waifus so i'm not surprised. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kancolle is dead, along with its threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ One day I'm gonna pull a cosplay like that off #$%
@#$ $#@ What Kancolle threads? #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe if you're brain dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ They don't have namefags or IRCfags, either. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just me or can coal is fading away as predicted? #$%
@#$ $#@ They also don't have a game #$%
@#$ $#@ Who wouldn't? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those that love someone else very much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is she bathing with her clothes on? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Alice retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ why then Kancolle "circle numbers" for the recents comikeks are above Touhou's? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or those are faked numbers? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I'm not one of those people #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Okuu very, very much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Names in games were being decided for SGDQ's through donations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Touhou Hijack managed to win against Iwata for Fallout 3's file name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just something I wondered since I was watching it and thought of you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ i didn't even mentioned touhou you dumb idiot, i was reffering to the fact that less doujin circles joined for kancolle this year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't know that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was wondering if you were talking about donations made during the two touhou games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Me too anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Very good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, that'd have been nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked their reaction to it though, guy didn't even know how to write it. #$%
@#$ $#@ But it's time to say goodbye #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course, its what they would want. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kagueru no contest, Yuugi is just gimmicky. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's Friday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shitposters are on parties so /v/ is slow as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because no one is making new ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its too bad probably only one person heard the shout out in the touhou block that was made to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you not make new threads? #$%
@#$ $#@ A nice little bit of time left to get comfortable before it's gone #$%
@#$ $#@ you press z to fire #$%
@#$ $#@ circles are fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Hold shift for focused movement #$%
@#$ $#@ Never said I was, just enjoying watching the waifufags be nice to each other and have fun while this slowly goes to page 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mind me asking, with absolute sincerity. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you play, Anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if you were joking or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Planescape isn't a video game #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo has always been garbage #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not buying a 400$ no game station so I can play a game I'm only moderately interested in 2 weeks earlier. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, I heard 4 was extra garbage #$%
@#$ $#@ expect no future mad max games after this one because the smart guys publishing it decided to release it the same day as MGSV and with barely any marketing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that really a bad thing? #$%
@#$ $#@ History has shown us that the more sequels a series gets the more likely it will turn to crap. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not interested with a mad max movie game, but I do love the setting and ideas. #$%
@#$ $#@ If companys see that there is no overall interest in something like this, expect less because publisher arnt going to risk investment if its not going to sell well. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Mad Max game probably wasnt going to get a whole lot of sales to begin with, but they could have done better with the marketing. #$%
@#$ $#@ battlefront is shit and Ill wait for the sequel to new vegas #$%
@#$ $#@ halo 5 isn't that bad #$%
@#$ $#@ the beta was pretty good #$%
@#$ $#@ the beta of most games are; they are small, concentrated parts of a larger picture which the devs choose as advertisement #$%
@#$ $#@ /tv/ will you please keep your garbage off other boards, we have enough stupid floating around here, we don't need any imported stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some graphic enhancer mods wouldn't hurt. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's alright #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this the neet thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ are /v/ bruhs anything like zebras? #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Umaru thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU MEAN CASUL THREAD, FUCKING WANNABE #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT MEME?! #$%
@#$ $#@ *blmips up* #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon there are like 4 Umaru threads in the catalog right now #$%
@#$ $#@ How is this thing a fucking teenage girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty clean and decent anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I expected weeb shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or conversely open launcher, speakers explode because why is the installer making noise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never thought #$%
@#$ $#@ Who did she play as? #$%

@#$ $#@ Reunion episode when? #$%
@#$ $#@ 5 seconds ago, LoL with my brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ With my brother, in 98. #$%
@#$ $#@ Annoying when they call just to ask how you're doing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Back in 2005 #$%
@#$ $#@ IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO REALIZE #$%
@#$ $#@ 7 years ago #$%
@#$ $#@ My brother and I used to play monster hunter freedom on psp back in the day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those were good times #$%
@#$ $#@ couple weeks ago played re5 mercs with my dad #$%
@#$ $#@ This doesn't make any sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow that's shit exchange rate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ruined my fucking night #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't go out of his was for the bottlecaps. #$%
@#$ $#@ He probably collected them for years and thought of an interesting way to pawn them off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Collected for 7 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beer drinkers get insane amount of bottle caps, I know that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most beer is in glass bottles. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least where I live. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, how many Bottle Caps do I need for a Pip-Boy Edition? #$%
@#$ $#@ This many. #$%
@#$ $#@ do you know how much it would cost to ship something that heavy #$%
@#$ $#@ NZ fag? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, a cursory glance on amazon shows a listing of one gross 144 of bottlecaps going for $6. #$%
@#$ $#@ Adjusting to this price, the value of 2,000 bottlecaps would be approximately $83, although it's probably lower. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, naaaah #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't have friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, fuck this show, and fuck my friend for watching this shit. #$%

@#$ $#@ I go to enough tournaments I don't really feel the need to netplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ id love to play you right now to see how good I would be against you. #$%
@#$ $#@ ay i'm not that guy but i'm down to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ just set it up so i'm not sure how this will work though #$%
@#$ $#@ ok fine hold on #$%
@#$ $#@ lmao never mind that's way too much to do and I'm too tired sorry. #$%
@#$ $#@ my internet is being a cunt so don't wait up only downloaded about 10%. #$%

@#$ $#@ Nice of you to help the poorfags make do with an inferior version, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, we'll meet one day. #$%
@#$ $#@ A part of me is in every falco you play. #$%
@#$ $#@ ay gg. #$%
@#$ $#@ sorry i suck lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ are you the guy I talked about Zhu and Cactuar with in a thread a few days or so ago? #$%
@#$ $#@ Invalid host go get thew newest dolphin a few posts after the top post #$%
@#$ $#@ I've got that, just had to change a setting real quick so I closed netplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless there's some other issue but I connected fine before. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jiggly is the anti-hype slow turtlely fun killer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either embrace the hatred or find a different character. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok whenever ur ready ill have ur code #$%
@#$ $#@ Try it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it still doesn't work I'll troubleshoot. #$%
@#$ $#@ well, I mean what else can you do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing against Jiggs just isn't that fun, can't really change that #$%
@#$ $#@ idk probably not #$%
@#$ $#@ I did like the Co op "raids" they came up with in the 2nd, where you had an objective on an open map and then a boss fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Online is shut down, but has local coop. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a great story and is presented well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not inherently bad but it's refreshing considering the current state of fps. #$%
@#$ $#@ Refreshing to not have it I mean. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's unnecessary and was shoehorned into every fps appease the modern warfare crowd for a cinematic feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ resistance wishes it was half as good as halo. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not Crysis so no #$%
@#$ $#@ CoD4 was a good game though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Killzone is a dead series as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just that Resistance is deader. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah resistance 2 was the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh right and H2 and R2 both have dumb shit cliffhanger endings. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played Halo and Halo 2 for the first time consecutively you nigger, and you are full of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually thought the third one was a little bit better. #$%
@#$ $#@ The second was easily the worst of the three. #$%
@#$ $#@ This was pretty much the only fps I played last gen as I kinda grew out of the genre so I can't say whether or not it was the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ it was amazing my brother never liked it which was strange since he was a playstation fanboy #$%
@#$ $#@ I was on the PS4 reddit I hate reddit like any proper /v/irgin, but PS4 disscussion isn't exactly welcome here and they are such faggots and say Resistance 2 is the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its painfully obvious R1 or 3 are much much better. #$%
@#$ $#@ R2 feels dated as fuck, so does 1, but at least 1 was unique. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 is just fucking perfect in my opinion, best story based shooter since HL2. #$%
@#$ $#@ 7 almost forgot reworked melee combat take a few notes from shadow warrior 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Every gun in R3 felt way better, and was way better in R3 than R2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know how anyone could say otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Servers are off #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it was fucking terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonybronys think it was good because that was like the only thing on the PS3 for the first 2 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ But in all honesty, Killzone and Resistance are hilariously bad compared to the halos and even cowadoody. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't help that the dualshocks before the 4 sucked ass for shooters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such a bad opinion tb%100h tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ What made you think it was meh? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, I remember those now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess it's just difference of opinion that I like R2 better #$%
@#$ $#@ But Halo hasn't been relevant in years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neither has video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can probably get each game for a dollar a piece now. #$%
@#$ $#@ As mediocre was the second game, I had a lot of fun playing Coop and multiplayer with friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing has been confirmed, but we can assume that it will be the same as the backgrounds of OP's picture, i.e., pink and green. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should consider getting a better taste then. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't like either of those things #$%
@#$ $#@ who /dog+rollercoaster+hot dog/ here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Campfire snacks? #$%
@#$ $#@ God those x-ray shots don't get old. #$%
@#$ $#@ The reason why I stopped playing gtao #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I like them more in NZA though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Felt more appropriate too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lol faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ fugg, lost the last few seconds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Third time lucky, I should have checked the webm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah bro high level players hunting down new players to insta kill them with their op weapons sure is fun and fair #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah thats the problem dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ High players who hunt lower players #$%
@#$ $#@ Level 48 is really low on, you need to be atleast level 150 or more to unlock EVERYTHING, a Buzzard can be bought the minute you start the game aslong as you have 2million, I've earned 2 billion so far, so 2million is nothing, it would take a week, a week and a half tops to amass that, fuck, it took me 3 hours to save up $200,000 GTAO Dollars fuck grinding, but I'd rather grind than pay before heists, so 3x10 = 30 hours at most if you just keep doing missions, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Replays m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit who the fuck cares. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're a much higher level than a level 1-20 player and when you hunt them down with shit that they don't have or little to no means to defend themselves its not fun for them #$%
@#$ $#@ Just slap on passive mode if you don't want to be killed. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's horrible game-design. #$%
@#$ $#@ The chicken and rice thing sounds cool, i'd go with that imho. #$%
@#$ $#@ My nigha you are absolute brotier. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't played it yet but I loved demon souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ I needed a console for a year and I haven't played the next gen and my labtop is basically for old and indie games so it's fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound like a cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ How old are these threads? #$%
@#$ $#@ They've been going on since I started coming here in 2009. #$%
@#$ $#@ I already liked season 1 of bojack but season 2 is even better, really great show #$%
@#$ $#@ its pretty good, i love cooking so i always try shit like that, always experimenting and trying new things in the kitchen. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is W10 I'm still debating upgrading #$%
@#$ $#@ get blasted off your ass and watch Another and laugh your ass off as it nosedives worse and faster than Gantz #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not kidding when I say I play it for only one day in like 3-4 months so havent really been arsed with mods. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still dont even know how enchantments work #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont doubt that anon, you can still play and do some stuff in a modded world in a day, and like i said, it's comfy. #$%
@#$ $#@ might wanna have a tutorial on another window or tab though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I'm gonna wait several months for the bugs to be worked out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only thing that sucks is the thing auto update every time I restart my PC and I can't find any way to delay it until next year. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah mate how do you like this episode so far? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was pretty bored tbh, but I don't want to spoil it either so I need to muscle through it.. #$%
@#$ $#@ I find myself just ignoring whole questions. #$%
@#$ $#@ hopefully it gets better. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm heading to the USA for a year after living in a small town in Ireland it's quite a change. #$%
@#$ $#@ After about 6 days the empty flat I got is starting to become comfy. #$%

@#$ $#@ How is pathfinder? #$%
@#$ $#@ Played 4e years ago and am trying to get back in and organize a 5e game but heard it was bretty gud #$%
@#$ $#@ straight shota, which tbh should from now on just be referred to as /s/ because nobody ever talks about gay shit is rarely relevant outside of trap threads #$%
@#$ $#@ Big John is the shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes the other posters are both correct #$%
@#$ $#@ wow thanks anon, got it #$%
@#$ $#@ Not anon but I'd wait for a few exclusives or multiplat games to release before getting a PS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bloodborne's not worth getting a PS4 for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ who is the goblin-proportioned goddess on the right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the DMC4 SE worth it? #$%
@#$ $#@ What does it add other than more playable characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is a great playlist #$%
@#$ $#@ Little Inferno, although it goes on a bit too long #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah shame we'll probably never even get nudes #$%
@#$ $#@ okcupid is bad new friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ the well adjusted are a small minority on that site #$%
@#$ $#@ I've got half of that covered, the keep working at it will come eventually I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go eat out at a restraunt, faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm still surprised how DAYUM-tier Meryl's portrait was, especially since I never found her that attractive "in-person." #$%
@#$ $#@ Good on you anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been the skinniest kid in the room for as long as I can remember, but now I'm starting to form a bit of a gut. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm determined to stop it dead in it's tracks, but I'm worried I'll just fall back into eating literal shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah they are more obsessed with white skin than any other azn country. #$%
@#$ $#@ But keep trying. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could always go the green card route. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitches will do anything for a green card... #$%
@#$ $#@ just watch out for gold diggers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd do that if the streets here weren't so narrow or filled with Massholes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think there is a way to reverse webm search and don't want to spoonfeed so here is more from the same girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've never been on a dating site but do people ever approach someone else with the intention of helping them lose weight so they can be more attractive? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or is that like super fucked up #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks holmes #$%
@#$ $#@ nice b8 #$%
@#$ $#@ fighting games are all about playing, just try to have fun or wait for sfv so you have more players which are on your level #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the Internet is a good time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really like the screen play that goes along with the album #$%
@#$ $#@ I watched the office again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such a demoralizing experience because the show goes to such shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but 70% of my biking is in front of the tv watching animu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Weather is often shitty here, so I got a roller. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best investment in my health ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Check out Kumail Nanjiani #$%

@#$ $#@ Floral green on the other hand is great #$%
@#$ $#@ I've reached the nirvana. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were your interests "cake"? #$%
@#$ $#@ So far I like it 100x better than win 8. #$%
@#$ $#@ The new browser is actually pretty great too. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont be a cuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Get ready for the action movie of the decade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fag of year award. #$%
@#$ $#@ See you at the 4am group meeting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who the fuck plays red dead online still #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck I love samurai champloo #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Titan Souls worth the money? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or is it just the soundtrack that's good? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's worth the money. #$%
@#$ $#@ I struggled on some of the fights and it felt comfy as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you feel better anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of them are dressed in skimpy outfits so whats the point? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it not hold back what it thinks I think it doesn't hold back? #$%
@#$ $#@ That just means you aren't trying hard enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ You lack discipline. #$%
@#$ $#@ what I wouldn't give to be a NEET again and do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude if you are having a stroke call 911. #$%
@#$ $#@ Happy Friday to you too, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to hold hands with XJ9! #$%
@#$ $#@ mount and blade warband multi player, I'm eating cold pizza with a grape smirnoff ice #$%
@#$ $#@ jesus christ i was asking for tips not talking shit about the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ defensive much? #$%
@#$ $#@ how so?, chel can use her fireball mid air you know #$%
@#$ $#@ Play a better game. #$%
@#$ $#@ meh: the game #$%
@#$ $#@ *C and D #$%
@#$ $#@ Just buy some bounty fertilizer and sell a bunch of rice. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll be rolling in cash. #$%
@#$ $#@ how bad is DG3 in comparison to DG1 with the weapons? #$%
@#$ $#@ I have bad friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thought that was obvious in that I mentioned I'd forgotten it exists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just cause I'm not obsessive about it doesn't mean I'm not a fan and I'm not looking forward to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a shame Kaine isn't the protag, woulda been cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you do NG+ and get ending B? #$%
@#$ $#@ if you didn't then you didn't finish shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm working through it. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's some more but still not feeling it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think last I finished was that bs text wall forest part. #$%
@#$ $#@ come to think of it, is it ever explained what happened to the drakengard universe after the events of Ending E? #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything was already super fucked. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a Yoko Taro game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm replaying Nier also. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't beaten scenario A yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ My dad died last december and I was bawling like a child while replaying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even some of the stories have happy endings like that one with blacksmith sisters falling out over trying to marry a skald and him making them reconcile by marrying both. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was very nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sadly, those retards didn't know how to destroy seals without killing the Guardians. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked that doujin where she fucked a shota Nier with her feminine dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kinda like DOD3's ground combat more, but I prefer DOD1's dragon combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dammit, I thought you said 3, not 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Day of Defeat 4 was being made? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kaine fucked a corpse? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well damn I thought she was a virgin #$%
@#$ $#@ You're a meme that needs to die. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yoko is pissed off everyone sees him as "that guy that makes miserable games", hes destroying himself, even further. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reviewers rarely spend more than five hours on a single game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, admittedly I didn't really notice Furiae until shortly after I saved it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still need to change the name. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also enjoyed DOD1's aerial missions much more. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're all spooky skeletons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Puppet Taro time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I didn't know this, understandable though, onii-chan Nier is pretty cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ DoD1 is a mustplay #$%
@#$ $#@ Play 1, if you can't stand the gameplay then read the LP I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nier's price has gone up because they announced a sequel at E3. #$%
@#$ $#@ She'd be adorable if she wasn't so fucking evil. #$%
@#$ $#@ It should still be like $20 at gamestop #$%
@#$ $#@ two right feet for a change #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a warning, ending D deletes your save data. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not bullshitting you, it really nukes your saves. #$%
@#$ $#@ sheeeit son looks like i already had them all #$%
@#$ $#@ Seere and Manah are more related to One than the orphans Two and Cent were taking care of. #$%
@#$ $#@ Drakengard 1 has god tier atmosphere, I miss playing it #$%
@#$ $#@ play the game and you'd know #$%
@#$ $#@ i did and i don't know #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a novella. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's an additional story for a boss in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ending A is pretty chill m8, though its bluepill as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ what the fuck is this #$%
@#$ $#@ One of Taro's original ideas for Drakengard 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did he have an idea of making DOD4 a game whose purpose was to find the plot for DOD3? #$%
@#$ $#@ Drakengard 5 when? #$%
@#$ $#@ I can honestly see those two getting along fairly well. #$%
@#$ $#@ The shade talk was heard by Kaine, thanks to her being part shade. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks for actually using spoiler tags. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't beaten D or C for that matter yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea this picture itself holds a shit ton of meaning too. #$%
@#$ $#@ After all that evil shit he carries her with him just to show her how evil she was....some pretty hardcore stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's easy as fuck to get all the weapons in nier, just do it #$%
@#$ $#@ Which spoilers did you hear? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if the ending is spoiled, it's the journey that'll get you the most. #$%
@#$ $#@ well you don't know shit then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're fine, quick get out of the thread and go play the game right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy's videos would be a lot better if he would stop the awful attempts at humor #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the journey, not the destination that matters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Choose a time thats right for you, cause once you go in theres no stopping till its over #$%
@#$ $#@ If you can get it emulating with minimal problems, then cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had to buy a physical copy in order to play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't doubt you, but where did you hear this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it in the game or Grimoire Nier? #$%
@#$ $#@ feels good because i'm not gay #$%
@#$ $#@ Kaine is the only legit case of feminine dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude needs a new computer, he's been having issues with Blue screens lately. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even better. #$%
@#$ $#@ This new android girl seems chill, and maybe that kid won't be an edgy little shit like Dito. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cry-On might've been just that, but that was cancelled sadly. #$%
@#$ $#@ its confirmed shes an android? #$%
@#$ $#@ makes you wonder if that shade the kid was hiding was his gestalt #$%
@#$ $#@ She didnt care since they killed her grandma and she was possessed by an asshole shade #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Growing Wings is one of my favorite songs in the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Taro likes to dress as Emil, does it mean he wants to fuck Nier? #$%
@#$ $#@ for the last time Taro had l i t e r a l l y nothing to do with Cry On #$%
@#$ $#@ What is Cry On, anyway? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the first time I heard of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I found it in a FUCKING GAMESTOP for 10 € like a week after the announcement #$%
@#$ $#@ Lol same here, i almost didnt get it but was like "eh fuck it i got nothing to lose" #$%
@#$ $#@ i dunno dude but it looks like golem survived anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ I prefer Zero x Five. #$%
@#$ $#@ They come in pack so both #$%
@#$ $#@ they twins so, i get both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both versions are fine as far as I know, I have the PS3 version and it runs fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mid-game I got spoiled that they were androids, but not what their job was, so I started to suspect Popola being a former secretary bot and Devola an entertainment-sex bot before the Happening, and then they just got new jobs in the post-apocalypse #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if Zero could handle an insatiable nymphomaniac like Five. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course she could. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ps3 for me too #$%
@#$ $#@ Dita handled it fine, he just didn't like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, not really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, one more question: Is it even worth it to level up Angelus, or just to rely on her next forms to do more damage in the long run? #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't find an answer, other than what the Dark Id wrote down in his LP. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know she gets a pretty big boost of damage when she levels up, you really don't need to farm for levels anyway, there really isn't much challenge if you know what you're doing and don't suck dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't farming, but was having fun doing the aerial missions and speed-nuking archers, because fuck them and their perfect aim, when I noticed that she was around Caim's levels and in her first form. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, I was curious if there was any benefit to it, or just use the forms. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus, every time I get the chance to play it, it's been months since I last did, so going through chapter 1 again to see what I forgot and leveling weapons to max equals 25. #$%
@#$ $#@ Insane, nah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Masochist, more than likely. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was told by a friend who played the shit out of DOD 1 and 2 that you needed to max ever weapon to get the last ending, so..yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that I know differently, I'm moving on to chapter 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your friend rused you, you have to get all the weapons but not max them out. #$%
@#$ $#@ My GameStop gained had people trading in the game en masse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes no sense, and they have five fucking copies now. #$%
@#$ $#@ People know other will want to buy it and they can make more money on it now than what they had it at before the announcement. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was cancelled in late 2008, well before Cavia went bankrupt. #$%
@#$ $#@ The reason Mistwalker gave for the cancellation was "poor economic conditions", so maybe it had something to do with the recession? #$%
@#$ $#@ calling DOD1 "good" is a bit of a stretch. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's still worth playing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, there's absolutely no shame in using a guide to find the weapons. #$%
@#$ $#@ The requirements for some of them are obtuse as fuck, and the game doesn't even hint at how to get any of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did print off a guide that gives all the locations and requirements to get them: "Kill X number, wait x minutes, do a jig on the back of the dragon". #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder how the hell anyone ever figured it out in the first place. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's all explained later. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's starting to sound like Emil with be protag #$%
@#$ $#@ That might also explain why Yoko Taro was wearing an Emil Mask at E3, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Emil will appear in the game but he'll be a side character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taro's stated that none of the characters from Nier will play a major role #$%
@#$ $#@ you know you love it #$%
@#$ $#@ Supposedly there are humans living on the moon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't how or why. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've heard this before, but I don't recall ever reading it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this from Grimoire Nier? #$%
@#$ $#@ If so, would mind pointing it out to me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its in the interview, Taro confirms it hinself but says it wasnt relevant to the immediate plot, thats why he didnt make abig deal of it #$%
@#$ $#@ DoD2 follows ending A #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda sorta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's a piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taro didn't direct it and more or less considers it noncanon #$%
@#$ $#@ Since Taro didn't direct it, it was considered noncanon. #$%
@#$ $#@ He eventually baptized it into official noncanon by putting it in its own quarantine timeline. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it takes place in a timeline similar to that of ending A, but not exactly. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it's canon, but really not at the same time. #$%
@#$ $#@ In Nier the humans had really advanced technology so its no surprise #$%
@#$ $#@ Taro never shows his face. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think there are some pics of him floating around #$%
@#$ $#@ The only one I know of is with him and a fan, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Delete this! #$%
@#$ $#@ DELETE IT OR I'LL WIPE YOUR ENTIRE PICS FOLDER. #$%
@#$ $#@ So Nier 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ But it isn't called Nier 2, its called Nier Unintelligible #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright then. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair Caim did not know either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then again I bet he did not care and it was a choice of two things "Find a way to break it while not killing the person it would take a long time or kill them" #$%
@#$ $#@ You know for someone who supposedly lost their beauty. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would still fuck Hanch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't ask me why, I just think that she would make some pretty lewd noises. #$%
@#$ $#@ DoD2 is only the Caim fight in the bed or roses and the Manah fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing else. #$%
@#$ $#@ officially they're calling it "New Nier Project" for now #$%
@#$ $#@ Taro is great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either way I want to record it and watch it in person. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again I bet he did not care. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've played D1 and Nier so far and I think the boss I've had most trouble with was batshit insane Furiae, by far #$%
@#$ $#@ Furiae's the most difficult boss in the game honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except for the final boss of course, have fun with that shit by the way. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Dragon gameplay is actually really fun in D1 too. #$%
@#$ $#@ after upgrading a few weapons the gameplay in D1 is far more enjoyable, it is pretty dull at the start unless if you main Caim's sword which a lot didn't. #$%
@#$ $#@ but even then it still takes a bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ here's your reply #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play the fucking games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus Christ lukewarms like you are annoying. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the first cutscenes of the game is Caim stabbing the corpse of a soldier and Inuart telling him he's full of bloodlust as always. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't kill everything he sees but he fucking loves it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah their terrible, its the premise and writing that is the only reason to play them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you rike it #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the best things in the world arrived on a whim or out of nowhere, #$%
@#$ $#@ Wan more! #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to fuck Poppo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never would be a safe bet #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like Santa needs to man up and beat the shit out of Poppo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Poppo is mass-produced though. #$%
@#$ $#@ A useless bunny can't fight that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then go after the source, kill Tomomo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Press enter to enter what you wish to enter. #$%
@#$ $#@ We don't have threads that often, but if you join the group we have lobbies daily that you can join #$%
@#$ $#@ There are daily lobbies announced if you join the steam group. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be afraid to start your own sometimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the bunny gets massproduced for breeding too #$%
@#$ $#@ Play the campaigns and you unlock several more characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ SOunds good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gave copies to my friends but they havent touched them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You buy the main characters' cards and you unlock them and their campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, the updated one #$%
@#$ $#@ OJs are for lewd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all of them are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saki is especially for lewd. #$%
@#$ $#@ DELETE THIS #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder what Saki's underboobs taste like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask Kae #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be mean to Fernet, she is a lovely young woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are now imaging QP assaulting Saki's breasts whit her tongue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fernet is the best! #$%
@#$ $#@ Let's be friends! #$%
@#$ $#@ Like nitro and gunpowder with a hint of C4 #$%
@#$ $#@ Provide me with a soundclip of "Allahu akbar" and that music that usually plays and it might be more likely to happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ So did Saki and Fernet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is Marc here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Sora a stoner? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sora got thrown into a war she didn't want to deal with and everybody she knew died. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like a Vietnam vet, so yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you the Poppo guy? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna see Aru delivering presents in nothing but thighhighs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never enough Fernet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I expected something other than plain white underwear for a girl like Fernet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is your favorite OJ, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the joke got too real for me, knowing people probably died from the gunfire that can be heard in the background. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still won't stop me from drawing Saki though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's something I desperately cling to due to the lack of Tomomo. #$%
@#$ $#@ This lobby will get one slot open in a bit #$%
@#$ $#@ nice anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Room for wan more! #$%
@#$ $#@ So is Hime supposed to be a canon lesbian? #$%
@#$ $#@ It always made me wonder. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hime can't be a lesbian because she is in love with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, you can buy them in the store #$%
@#$ $#@ sjams pls #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a game? #$%
@#$ $#@ From Orange Juice. #$%
@#$ $#@ It hasn't been released nor is there any gameplay footage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard to say what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you look hard enough you can find some concept art, and I believe one or two of the characters are supposed to be in Mixed Juice. #$%
@#$ $#@ iirc it was a collaboration they wanted to do for a comiket that didn't work out and got cancelled, instead they did 200% Mixed Juice #$%
@#$ $#@ All of them, of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slot open! #$%
@#$ $#@ you're outdated #$%
@#$ $#@ i never dated to begin with #$%
@#$ $#@ Fernet is my wife. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should get a divorce. #$%
@#$ $#@ This fucking bot dude, so bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ You're delusional. #$%
@#$ $#@ QP pls leave #$%
@#$ $#@ Hug me bro, I'm in the same #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here, searching doesn't help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remade the lobby. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone see it now? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know, is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesn't beat Krillin dual-wielding hair colors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cute girls with animal ears is working. #$%
@#$ $#@ ONLY GOOD FOR SEX APPEAL #$%
@#$ $#@ Try what with Sora or Suguri? #$%
@#$ $#@ But that's lewd! #$%
@#$ $#@ How does that work? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't even the host. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is just not the same without jam #$%
@#$ $#@ One of those is her tail. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play the campaign for a bit to get a feel for how the game works, and then just jump into multiplayer when you feel like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't really "git gud" apart from learning basic character tactics and avoiding obvious dumbass mistakes #$%
@#$ $#@ read Sun-Tzu and practique 25 hours a day #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't join lobbies with tripfags #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are Poppo's eyes so soulless and empty? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shouldn't that be Kai? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, what the fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ We've been over this. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can acquire food and more with the lightsaber. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its what you can do with that glowing katana. #$%

@#$ $#@ Another Game in another city with another cast #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU KEEP CALLING #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, different setting, different characters is what I'd like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heck, I'd take a game featuring Rhyme at this point, girl needs some gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT THE HELL?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Found the faggot that picked bulbanigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Misty and her starmie raped my ass hole when I first played with my nigga squirtle #$%

@#$ $#@ He's the first pokemon, and my first pokemon, and will always be my favorite. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not submissive but I do love cute boys now #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I had Pikachu #$%
@#$ $#@ Because he's easy mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Real men use Charmander #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is littered with grass types. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just walk on tall grass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Water and fire types come accessible much later. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's pokemon nigger, if you're worried about how strong each one you have with you is you're a mouth breathing retard #$%
@#$ $#@ To have fun #$%
@#$ $#@ umaru chan best game super happy fun cart go go go #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd play it #$%

@#$ $#@ unless they're dirty fucking casuals. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck why did I not think of this #$%
@#$ $#@ Rocket League #$%
@#$ $#@ you were distracted #$%
@#$ $#@ them melons though #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a bad news for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do I start her s. #$%
@#$ $#@ link, though? #$%
@#$ $#@ I already have max Academics, but she won't talk to me after school. #$%
@#$ $#@ You also need to score #1 in an exam to start her s-link #$%
@#$ $#@ Once she gets over her daddy issues she'll talk to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is the girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ P3P FeMC #$%
@#$ $#@ Final boss #$%
@#$ $#@ The Noncanon Messiah #$%
@#$ $#@ Q was solid for a fanservice game, but god damn why couldn't they just throw her in as an option #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Q is supposed to be canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ When her persona evolves she loses that weakness though #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey Shinji why the long face #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be stupid and check again #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll need to cover 2 elements as well as any emergency healing and light/dark, in that case. #$%
@#$ $#@ Akihiko and Mitsuru can both heal, but they don't have any party heals, which you might need later on. #$%
@#$ $#@ you fucking bastard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm retarded killing myself #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you ever need that when you have cool breeze and can heal everyone after every battle? #$%
@#$ $#@ If your party is anything other than Yukari, Junpei and Akihiko, just end yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who's TK? #$%
@#$ $#@ Da Man/Did you see that, Shinji?/Toaster #$%
@#$ $#@ Great team, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ WHO'S DA MAN #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't like her one bit and she was shoehorned in my face in the last quarter of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've spent the whole game building bonds with Y, J &amp; A, I'm not gonna replace them with someone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice bait, but I'm not falling for it ! #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not for no reason, it's preference. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to go with the harem team and I did. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game isn't that hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ *or Soma #$%
@#$ $#@ I've played the game, but could someone explain the joke, it flew over my head. #$%
@#$ $#@ any particular reason why they're ducks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shinji dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only FeMC can save him,but she's not canon so...canon says he's dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ His FeMC Slink, apparently. #$%
@#$ $#@ Q is canon, so no best girl allowed. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's completely obvious he has already beaten it or at least knows that, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry anon, you've been outmemed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yep sure is nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Will he ever smile again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Weak to bullets #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ Mah nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Monad fam #$%
@#$ $#@ A-at least we got those shitty mechwarrior games, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ RAGNAROK IS OP YOU BITCHASS NO FAIR #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek does he have a podcast like the rest of them? #$%
@#$ $#@ Never hear anyone mention these. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ The rain effects in that game are comfy #$%
@#$ $#@ motha fukas done fucked up BIG time #$%
@#$ $#@ OP you fucked up already. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lots of people have played that. #$%
@#$ $#@ your brother managed to get his clan on first place? #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you talkign about you fucking orc? #$%
@#$ $#@ the game was impossible the first time but then you learn how the mechanics work and learn how dangerous enemy magic is and how OP your holy healing is, is only a game of using "X" weakness and moving your "X" away from its weakness, loved the ending tough, they ruined by making a spin off. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game was one of the first games I've ever played. #$%
@#$ $#@ The whole reason why I got an Xbox was because I thought MechAssault would be just like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ There you go #$%
@#$ $#@ I can almost imagine the disappointment from expecting something similar to mech2 and then playing the mechassault games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The OST in PGR 2 was god-tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ played it. #$%
@#$ $#@ A step back from its n64 predecessor. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played the shit out of Jumping Flash 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ I played it for the first time emulated on the xblox, tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ atleast they didnt name it mechwarrior and try to pass it off as the same thing #$%
@#$ $#@ When will Nintendo be held accountable for their lies? #$%
@#$ $#@ To bad the studio defunct. #$%
@#$ $#@ We will never get PGR 5 #$%
@#$ $#@ A proper Xbox emu is long overdue tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be a shame if all those awesome exclusives were lost in time. #$%
@#$ $#@ THERE WAS A THIRD? #$%
@#$ $#@ you're a fucking idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ this was one of the most popular Xbox Live games at the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ It got cancelled. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the Panzer Dragoon Orta game for Xbone coming out? #$%
@#$ $#@ I had that for gamecube, the last unlock was a 3 wheeler, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ I played the beta... #$%
@#$ $#@ It was weird. #$%
@#$ $#@ Phil's been talking up first-party games so maybe one day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus MS is really sitting on a gold mine of IPs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't kicking them in the teeth might be the best thing to happen to them in a long time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be sorry, if it was good I'd have to get an Xbone, now I can skip it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hadn't heard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had ATV 3 Offroad Fury for PS2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Crimson Dragon is alright, but yeah, its nowhere close to Orta #$%
@#$ $#@ The paintball cheat in Nascar '98 was GOAT #$%
@#$ $#@ triggered hard #$%
@#$ $#@ Rented this so much I wonder why I never bought it when I was young. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ended up stealing it from the blockbuster. #$%
@#$ $#@ how the fuck you were supposed to reach those green spray cans on the sky? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now or never mac #$%
@#$ $#@ unless its unopened mint condition, no #$%
@#$ $#@ have you considered getting good? #$%
@#$ $#@ anon i was so good at my age, but no car, not even the fastest was able to reach them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've still got 2, but i lost my copy of 1 a while back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shame 2 was so damn short, i was replaying it a couple weeks back and i beat it in maybe 6 hours. #$%
@#$ $#@ It seemed so much longer when i was 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that terrible Vietnam game on PS4 a sequel to this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I one of the few people who played and loved Full Spectrum Warrior??? #$%
@#$ $#@ it got a ton of 9/10 and 10/10 reviews back during the trade publications days. #$%
@#$ $#@ People loved it even though its UI was a bulky piece of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ this game was great #$%
@#$ $#@ The one I've seen has been there forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ is that cole phelps #$%
@#$ $#@ wow atleast you have money for the game and a vacation fag from.mad poorfag #$%
@#$ $#@ op eat shit #$%
@#$ $#@ post more MGSV name cards #$%
@#$ $#@ OP here, I planned it months before TPP had a release date #$%
@#$ $#@ because MGSV will never see a vita port #$%
@#$ $#@ I used it to sext with my first girlfriend #$%
@#$ $#@ Where can i find more of these? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a good thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you really want it launching in its current state? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you really think more time will fix a game so flawed to its core? #$%
@#$ $#@ Needed more time to market the game, most likely. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldn't it be more satisfying to see someone make a good game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sprites are nice, but no. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not so rigid that I can't enjoy a 3D game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megaman wasn't good BECAUSE it was 2D, it was good because it was tight. #$%
@#$ $#@ The 2D was incidental to the era. #$%
@#$ $#@ yo ho ho and a bottle of cuck! #$%
@#$ $#@ telling lies about being the creator of megaman #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, /v/ knew he was only partially involved in Megaman's creation LONG ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ This isn't breaking news. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's only a problem now because people are digging for reasons to hate him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe it's a problem because he presented himself as the creator and guardian of Megaman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her boyfriend. #$%
@#$ $#@ When will they ever learn. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is she replying to? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, because he didn't use the false fact to get people to give him money for a game until MN9. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is this hard to understand? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just going to sit on a shelf for 8 months and maybe actually lose a feature or two #$%
@#$ $#@ It gained him quite a bit of notoriety before the kickstarter, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ So that's only a technicality. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some goober harassed her on twitter #$%
@#$ $#@ that is a painful image #$%
@#$ $#@ But it's impossible to harass someone who is terrible #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't be sad about backing Skullgirls, Shovel Knight, or FTL. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those games delivered. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless they cut it out of the game, it was planned. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it, where's the racism? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice blog, added to favorites! #$%
@#$ $#@ They had to cut stealing powers from regular enemies, but boss powers are still in I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy sh*t your mad lol. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just uhm, like, accept that I'm better than you and more smarter with my money...? #$%
@#$ $#@ Will he respond? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oyvind you are so funny #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks guys! #$%
@#$ $#@ Be sure to check out my Patreon too! #$%

@#$ $#@ Don't forget to like and comment on my JewTube bideo goy #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine Tim Schafer, Keiji Inafune and Peter Molyneux could working in the same game, it would the best mess of an almost created game humanity would ever see #$%
@#$ $#@ They could've licensed UbiArt and everything but no, we got shittier Powered Up grafx #$%
@#$ $#@ Get back to work, Patrick. #$%
@#$ $#@ GET BACK TO DRAWING RIGHT THIS SECOND PMHTGHOST AND GET OFF OF /V/ AND NEVER COME THE FUCK BACK. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off shill #$%
@#$ $#@ That image has been true for years, where have you been? #$%
@#$ $#@ All that's left is d-list e-celeb shitposting and viraling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus fucking Christ, imagine the trolling during development, /v/ could get a ton of money to pay some kickstarter shit like making sonichu with blue arms and making CWC flaming homo #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like they're still living in the 90's when developers were always pressured to shove in 3D elements into their games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honest question, why was she hired? #$%
@#$ $#@ What was on her resume that got her the job? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just did you fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget console war threads which are really just the shills flinging shit at each other. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okami and sub sandwich better investments than mighty shit number nine confirmed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing except that he boyfriend was on the community management team. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its funny how people who got attributed to games like Inafune to Iga, to creators who lack self control with using budget like Tim who used to be seen as legends are now being seen to what they really are. #$%
@#$ $#@ So do it the right way then, if you even can, Capcom-kun. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's bullshit, but now I have to research her skills in "tits" #$%
@#$ $#@ They already conformed that idea was dropped for good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Partly because it wasn't a 'goal', so they didn't have to directly stick with it ether. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is obviously a huge fan of the games, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a new low for you, /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Tight budget" #$%
@#$ $#@ I would, as long as she has a big, hairy crotch bush. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a sad day when industry villains are right #$%
@#$ $#@ Same boat as you and likely other anons, but I got more faith in Iga. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, don't they have a publisher for Bloodstain out of the gates? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I'm glad I didn't touch that either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't inafune leave Legends 3 because he was upset that people wouldn't see it as "A keji inafune" game or something like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ yep that's why he left. #$%
@#$ $#@ and then after the game got canned he begged capcom to let him work on it from Comcept #$%
@#$ $#@ have you checked red ash ks? #$%
@#$ $#@ it actually went down 3 k since this morning #$%
@#$ $#@ Awesome plan, I think I'll order a sub and play some Okami. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank anon! #$%
@#$ $#@ No, you fucking clown, she banned him from the forums and kickstarter because he had gamergate posts on his twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ He posted about it to his own twitter, without her name. #$%
@#$ $#@ She posted that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Toru Hagihara did most of the work with Iga and rest of the team finishing it up after Konami let him go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this official or fanart? #$%
@#$ $#@ Turns out they spent all the cash making all those console ports #$%
@#$ $#@ reminder that she was supposed to be an example of comcept hiring the fans, its just mega man fans are so autistic they found out that she knew the team before hand and does not play mega man #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK THAT GUY WHO I JUST LEARNED ABOUT! #$%
@#$ $#@ HE SURE DOES SUCK, R-RIGHT FELLAS? #$%
@#$ $#@ The "Physical Edition" wasn't actually a disc, it was just a USB drive with the game on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ People got fucking pissed when Comcept said that people couldn't opt to get the actual physical edition if they donated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Official, it's from a Korean MMORPG called Rockman Online. #$%
@#$ $#@ actually Shovel Knight was made with less that 500K #$%
@#$ $#@ And look how long the stretch goals are taking them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't know, but they did some how get well over $5 million out of the original $500,000 goal. #$%
@#$ $#@ but they weren't going to publish physical copies, were they? #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you heard of 20XX on steam, by chance? #$%
@#$ $#@ Except development's already finished. #$%
@#$ $#@ to be fair, they were also porting, adding exclusive content to said ports and figuring out how to publish physical copies of their game #$%
@#$ $#@ I just checked out the steam trailer. #$%
@#$ $#@ it looks kinda cheap imo but its got a good megaman x feel to it #$%
@#$ $#@ Gunvolt 2 when #$%
@#$ $#@ Did they really make a shitty cell phone game with 4 million dollars? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not the point, people should've have expected the game to be hand drawn. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it don't you think they would've made a point of that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes but I kinda don't like the artstyle #$%
@#$ $#@ comcept just denied that the game was getting delayed. #$%
@#$ $#@ this turd's still dropping in september afterall #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, on Amazon the date was changed from September to a placeholder date. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it could be true, #$%
@#$ $#@ he probably wouldn't have run up the budget if he didnt release physical copies #$%
@#$ $#@ I backed Bloodstained and the TruForce X figure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Call is not hideous, you cuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, I'd say Mega Man X8 looks better, despite being released two gens prior on weak hardware with a not-good artstyle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, good thing they didn't go with E, amirite? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even X7 looks better and X7 was, and still is, a gigantic steaming turd of a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ No hope whatsoever #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst case scenario, we'll get some porn out of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you care? #$%
@#$ $#@ He did program for the game, though he himself admitted the first director was better than him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I don't have much faith in kickstarters especially the ratio in success and failures are a wide margin on the latter. #$%
@#$ $#@ And supposed geniuses continue to flounder on there so I'm not getting my hopes up. #$%
@#$ $#@ If its good, its good, if it isn't, then I saved myself some money. #$%
@#$ $#@ No stuns in hard mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the main chick isn't even that hot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't say good porn. #$%
@#$ $#@ In your shitty opinion #$%
@#$ $#@ It sucks that X8 was much better than x7 but it flopped hard as all hell #$%
@#$ $#@ powered up actually had some idea of visual design beyond 'throw random contrasting colours together that don't even fit in with the level theme and slap random unreal engine post processing effects on it'. #$%
@#$ $#@ it also had models and animations that actually resembled the 2d character designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ megaman 7 was good too... #$%
@#$ $#@ the controls may have been a bit clunkier but it wasn't a bad game. #$%
@#$ $#@ X8 was a follow up to two of the worst X games ever made, which were released back to back. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that it did well enough to give us CM and Day of Sigma at least counts for something, based on those conditions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasn't it the first game to have Hideki Ishikawa as the artist too? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've always thought that he was the best artist/designer for Classic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels real good man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some kickstarter was promising a $9 computer a while back and I was interested but held off. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will never back a kickstarter #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, they could be lying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also reports have spawned today on a potential delay so things could've changed. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sure as fuck can call them out on bullshit yet believe this one teeny thing #$%
@#$ $#@ He actually killed Lost Planet 3 too. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series just got a new director and a new cartoon is coming in a year or two. #$%
@#$ $#@ Capcom must have a new game planned #$%
@#$ $#@ Amanda Please went down a while back. #$%
@#$ $#@ it was from an old draw thread so I think it's a parody scene from Toy Story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, Lost Odyssey is fantastic. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only reason why MM8/MM&amp;B Roll is taller is because of an artstyle change. #$%
@#$ $#@ They didn't actually grow #$%
@#$ $#@ Haven't actually heard anything on that end in ages, do we know how it's going? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ La Mulana for girls? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is about as terrifying as it is an exciting prospect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you think it will be a new offshoot? #$%
@#$ $#@ "Megaman Boom" perhaps? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well it was up for a while, long after the show ended. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did all the Hard stages as Roll, and goddamn it if CWU wasn't king of the motherfuckers. #$%
@#$ $#@ You had to plan every single moment of that fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lost Planet was shit since the first game though, I went in expecting an epic adventure game about surviving in a harsh environment and ended up with a mediocre third person shooter with a time limit and some really cringeworthy writing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man 8 had some boss-ass music. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't have to do a lot of searching for good tracks there. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd say only Wily 3 and 4 are weak. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ha ha what perfect timing. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's Julie you weaboo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did it go like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought he was fired, not quitting on his own accord, since he's been freelance for quite some time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who cares, I will call her the red bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ At least we know inside of him still beats the heart of a redblooded fellow. #$%
@#$ $#@ He likes em a little young, but it's not like Capcom didn't sexualize them first. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's Japan #$%
@#$ $#@ I still find it funny that even with all the bullshit that it had, the American Megaman Cartoon was more on point with the plot than the Street Fighter and Darkstalkers cartoons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone here said that so really it could be bullshit, dunno #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a guilty pleasure of mine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure it ran off in its own directions, but I rather liked the teenage one-liner spewing Megaman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even their Roll was pretty hot. #$%
@#$ $#@ The studio who did 8's cutscenes...XEBEC? #$%
@#$ $#@ They did just about every Mega Man anime, including X4, Day of Sigma, and the EXE and Starforce animu. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'd be really nice if they got to work again on Mega Man, but their work on the Pokemon films and Origins was nice too. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's fucking luanne from king of the hill. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can hear the voice already #$%
@#$ $#@ Roll ain't no hillbilly. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's a sophisticated piece of hardware. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's supposed to come out in september #$%
@#$ $#@ i stop playing after i reach bullshit jumping puzzle in the tower, its frustrating because the control is not responsive for jump in the first place, how many times i die because accidentaly dashing? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not for her #$%
@#$ $#@ R-S Roll was Kathleen Barr, also Kevin and the blue-haired Kanker from EE&amp;E. #$%
@#$ $#@ Luanne was Brittany Murphy, who's dead now. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn this game is so good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they actually made money off of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are they developing anything new? #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually liked Yeti's stage, but ManOWar's was inexcusable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Their biggest mistake was putting it on the PSP. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they just didn't bother with LP3 and instead localized ET and marketed a bit it could have done decently here like how MH3 &amp; 4 have done well here. #$%
@#$ $#@ But alas, this is the same company that promises a sequel to highly successful new IP and two years later instead reveals a fucking terrible F2P game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well it's not like they knew the PSP was going to play second banana to the DS at the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can the series what? #$%
@#$ $#@ They should have at least ported the games once the sales numbers made it clear. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would love for them to make 3ds ports of the games but that'll never happen... #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it was not putting it on PSN. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck the online glitch excuse. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they can act like nothing's wrong with other digital ports missing bits and pieces, they can sack up and let me put my favorite PSP game on Vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ How long until Fupoo becomes the next Mad Thad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Maverick Hunter X was on the US PSN store last time I checked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there drama with that artist? #$%
@#$ $#@ When we see those Baby Rosalina images. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair Sony was top dog for two entire generations in a row by that point, and they had no way of knowing Sony would shit the bed hard the following year. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, and I have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Powered Up isn't, and CoA is saying it's because digital copies can't connect online. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well there is no delay, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the game turning out like this shouldn't surprise anyone who followed that pirate penguin game that was supposed to be released last year but was canceled for him trying to pull the same shit he's doing now with MN9. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never, since Mad Thad was a legitimate pedophile, while FuPoo just loves Roll too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ FuPoo draws older women and big tits all the time too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lolicons are degenerates #$%
@#$ $#@ Maverick Hunter X isn't nearly as good #$%
@#$ $#@ What did I just get from this code, you nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish capcom would love their fans again... #$%
@#$ $#@ it looks like they might announce a new game in 2017 becaue the series has a new director and a cartoon is coming out in 2017 #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm still skeptical. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any number of things could sink that in the course of 2 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ The biggest being CoJ. #$%
@#$ $#@ here is game play ive seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ dash dash dash dash dash dash dash. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks boring as shit, im mad i donated #$%
@#$ $#@ he straight up said work WITH western devs, he never once said outsource. #$%
@#$ $#@ He said he liked western work ethic. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can list a million reasons to hate him, but he showed it could work, working with a western dev with dead rising 2, might not be as great as dr 1 but it still felt like a dead rising game, when dr3 came out and done solely by capcom vancouver the same people who made dr2 it was fucking garbage #$%
@#$ $#@ When did Inafune say he didn't want to make a Megaman game? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a rather key difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah west devs are assholes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Double fine asking for more money before even releasing their game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ethics of a sack of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Capcom did that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its been well known the 3DS port is requiring extensive retooling because of UE. #$%
@#$ $#@ The official website, steam, and many other reputable stores still have it listed at 9/15 for all platforms. #$%
@#$ $#@ Square's store has the WiiU version changed recently to reflect a delayed date, but only the WiiU. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because he left when the project was barely off the ground. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except that's clearly not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why didn't Capcom produce it with anyone else after Inafune left then? #$%
@#$ $#@ So he left because Capcom refused to have his named plastered all over the game or some shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ That really is indeed sad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Protag of La-Mulana 2 is actually Lemeza's daughter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because they didn't think it would sell. #$%
@#$ $#@ And so far, it's proving to be true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Inafune was an idiot for thinking Capcom cared about NO BACKSIES. #$%
@#$ $#@ Capcom were assholes for killing it on the same day they released the MM fanart compilation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the 4 million #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck you. #$%
@#$ $#@ People not wanting Chinese Lunchbox Red Megaman Legends is not proof of anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ And this is exactly how I know Bloodstained isn't going to deliver either. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only play 98 because it was the one always available at any small places, of course, going to arcade places, they had the updated ones #$%
@#$ $#@ 98 is the best kof #$%
@#$ $#@ Jess was goat, he didn't last long enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ He got really chill later. #$%
@#$ $#@ No tips for you, you silly dumb nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Apple games or iphone games? #$%
@#$ $#@ When I think Apple I think Apple computer like old macintosh games. #$%
@#$ $#@ iphone games, sorry for that #$%
@#$ $#@ tbh that Grunty tho rest of the design is pretty meh smh #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Grunty should be fat and ugly or boney and scrawny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless they make Tooty being big and ugly canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ ur mum #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this the game that Grunty will make at the end of Nuts &amp; Bolts? #$%
@#$ $#@ for yourself? #$%
@#$ $#@ we're here 5ever fam #$%
@#$ $#@ It's better than their N&amp;B design, at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't it the opposite? #$%
@#$ $#@ If she's pretty and good looking then its sexist and empowers male fantasy by having all women be good looking? #$%
@#$ $#@ The signs all point to it...probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to FUCK that Kazooie #$%
@#$ $#@ Generals are only for threads that consistently start as soon as one ends. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's too big a downtime to justify making a general. #$%
@#$ $#@ are you fucking with me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the main requirement for a general. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think back to what lolg used to be when it was here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that takes me back. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could probably use CE and change some random shit item like an onigiri into the key. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to the boat in the harbor and leave. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will end your run as if you died but that's the only other way to see your full summary. #$%
@#$ $#@ end the game #$%
@#$ $#@ for missions like the thiefs pick up green bags that net you more money goes away if you leave #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget the catalog pre-/vp/, where literally every other thread was some bullshit about what pokeyman plush you wanted to jam up your butthole. #$%
@#$ $#@ In the thief-taker mission, if you enter the target area, you get a bonus for killing the target immediately. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you leave and come back, you lose that bonus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wonder when you'd showed up. #$%
@#$ $#@ now im just waiting for the getting sloppy ps3 seconds guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't, baka gaijin #$%
@#$ $#@ All jap speak with english subs #$%
@#$ $#@ [Good luck]! #$%
@#$ $#@ But which one came first! #$%
@#$ $#@ If I want to build from parts and have enough mats to grind for good charms, how many of each part should I have? #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't you unlock that with the dlc? #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah but it's not enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd pay for tsubohachi, mifune kand kenji. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell i'd even take the three fucking stooges. #$%
@#$ $#@ Random, each time you dissemble it again all the parts will roll for their charm slots again. #$%
@#$ $#@ No you shouldn't ever lose weapons from a cycle ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will keep any equipped stuff on you and your weapon stack will move to your chest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well maybe you would if your weapon chest was full but I have never had that happen so don't know what happens in that case. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing I can think of is, did you get the scene where Laura holds your hand while leaving the dango place? #$%
@#$ $#@ I do #$%
@#$ $#@ Each one has requirements, just search for a faq. #$%
@#$ $#@ Short version is do really well on torture minigames for the sisters, give fish to Akemi and beat Megamelons up at every opportunity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck this gay game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you also need to avoid talking to JJ at the consulate gate during the night at all #$%
@#$ $#@ Styles are not difficulty dependent. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can get them all on normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ They even tend to be easier to get to drop on easy because on harder difficulties they are more likely to get swapped out for food items or weapon parts. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I see why everyone likes this game so much, the character editor is fucking great #$%
@#$ $#@ what program are you using to make it act like an xbone 360 controller? #$%
@#$ $#@ There are a shitload of good ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try them out. #$%
@#$ $#@ See what you like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to kill the sisters and the minister #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, gonna try again next playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Put up with enough bullshit, she gon die this run. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do more damage, attack faster, take less damage, no not back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its murder spree mode, just cut the fuck out of everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shinobi styles are a bit shit all round I find, barely any range, unimpressive damage and attacks aren't even that fast. #$%
@#$ $#@ What's it called? #$%
@#$ $#@ Can it drop from any random pranja? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the styles from the big named NPCS are pretty good, since you have to fight at least one of them to finish the tournament you're guaranteed to get at least one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd also recommend also taking the time to murder Mori or the Smith for their unarmed styles, might be useful in the golden end path #$%
@#$ $#@ Main problem with Dual wield is that the highest rank of Toughen they can get is 50% which is a bit of problem on Harakiri. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's a big wakizashi #$%
@#$ $#@ can you make custom dual wield style? #$%
@#$ $#@ because that would solve the issue #$%
@#$ $#@ Anata no tame ni #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm afraid it does not my friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ No duel wield styles have Toughen Expert so you can't learn it to put on a custom style. #$%
@#$ $#@ To clarify, learning Toughen Expert with say a Waki style wouldn't let you put it on a custom Duel Wield style it would only let you put it on custom Waki Styles. #$%
@#$ $#@ wow that's gay #$%
@#$ $#@ I forgot his name but that guy in your screenshot is supposed to have Hiroshi Fujioka's face right? #$%
@#$ $#@ I only see Hongo when I see him. #$%
@#$ $#@ A belt like this but with different colors is also in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Welcome to /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy crap, guess i still have much blood to spill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Vitality lets you/enemies recover HP, if you hit them with the reversed sword you can reduce all their vitality and stop them healing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had the same issue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Early on your weapon is really shit due to low damage so most fights are hard on fuck to win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Press confirm on the ??? #$%
@#$ $#@ spots in your style and it'll tell you what you need to do to unlock that move. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dojima is a hard fight on a first playthrough, if you have the patience you can deplete his vit and murder him or keep him in a loop with the initial unarmed style. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its gonna look a little this except in the cementary #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but i still have no idea what the charms are or what they do. #$%
@#$ $#@ I imagine they give buffs but i don't see how to check exactly what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only ones that matter are Big shot Greatly increased damage for guardbreaking/unblockable moves and Life&amp;Death Gradual Vit regeneration while standing still. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are special effects your swords give you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't think it actually says in game what each one does but the two main ones you want to look for are 'Life and Death' which gives you Vit regen and Big Shot that makes any guard break moves plus some others do SUPA damage and makes even Harakiri easy mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll keep my eyes for them then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quite strange to not tell us what they do but not without precedents with jap games. #$%
@#$ $#@ no, in one run and in under 2 hours #$%
@#$ $#@ no that honor belongs to Akagi #$%
@#$ $#@ Another reason to stand against Pranja faggots #$%
@#$ $#@ can't ruse me, aniki #$%
@#$ $#@ Megamelons is barely even plot relevant, how can she be annoying? #$%
@#$ $#@ Like shes literally replaced if killed. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could but it makes them aggro against you #$%
@#$ $#@ her original name is Melinda de Cameron #$%
@#$ $#@ Why was it changed? #$%
@#$ $#@ When a jap tries to say it sounds like Deka Meron on something like that, they tried to translate the pun and in the process stopped it from being a pun at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you didn't stay with her #$%
@#$ $#@ Magistrate ending where you leave with Moro is probably the happiest other than the true one. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the bros live and prosper and the only ones fucked are the Pranja faglords and Kotobuki. #$%
@#$ $#@ WotS4, Akiba was first to get ported to pc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, what? #$%
@#$ $#@ An ending screen? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jumping from the ship doesn't lead to the one man army magistrate assault? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Japanese version of her name was basically Melinda DeCameron, but in Japanese it was spelt out has dekameron, which pretty much means "big melons." They sacrificed her name to keep the original idea intact. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pistols or UnarmedNo idea what my character says but it helps if you think hes quoting HNK #$%
@#$ $#@ this shit happened to me the first time i did the consulate path, i was kicking the shit out of the demonscales in spring harvest and when i sheathed the sword she was dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ i was like "oh shit, what have i done" #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you find version 1.04? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shinobi, Dual Shinobi, and Iai are my favorites. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, I was playing 1.0 that still has several bugs #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the rewards for the hospital mission is getting tortured. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can get a torture session by doing the closing down the hospital event and asking to play rather than having a reward. #$%
@#$ $#@ But getting arrested is the fastest way to get tortured. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats not even prajna path I was talking about you fag #$%
@#$ $#@ Perfect Iai is a mook drop #$%
@#$ $#@ Any in particular, or just pray to a god? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are the tortures random? #$%
@#$ $#@ I keep getting the iron horse and she just slaps me after. #$%
@#$ $#@ depends on crime rate #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Ahara why you never die #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you saved that smile, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I-I'm working on it ok? #$%
@#$ $#@ M-maybe next time ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ Perfect Iai, I remember getting that from a dojo challenger hes a pretty early/repeat offender so you should find him quick #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a way to check crime rate and what is the easiest way to increase it/get arrested? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure I got one from a ronin or a samurai. #$%
@#$ $#@ So close to most people's favorite ending #$%
@#$ $#@ You beat her up at every opportunity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not kill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beat up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Time only advances when you sleep or complete main plot events. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't kill the foreigner unless you strike first you bloodthirsty ronin. #$%
@#$ $#@ He can kill the foreigner? #$%
@#$ $#@ He wouldn't kill the foreigner when I did that quest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Irredeemable piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Notice my sword isn't even drawn. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regular guy leaves after day 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Normal smithy retires after/ at day 4 so no ccheap poshies for you anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is where I was and I found the girl and the dead guy in read. #$%
@#$ $#@ I send her to a clothing store idk why my character knows about a job opening and when I came back into the map they're still not there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try talking to the thief guy again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hit them twice/thrice, then if they fight back knock em out and see if they want to join you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Blondie knights in the consulate always fight back #$%
@#$ $#@ keep hitting them until you can talk to them while they're on their knee #$%
@#$ $#@ WotS the most viraled game on /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go for nurses in the hospital. #$%
@#$ $#@ blondies are only worth 3 points so no nightly pleasure. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah that's the whole point of the dojo's chests #$%
@#$ $#@ It's always custom. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kogure's kasshin is a favourite though. #$%
@#$ $#@ corpse walk is the GOAT #$%
@#$ $#@ You can die by getting slapped? #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay thanks, the guides I read implied I could move stuff between saves. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll finish this game then. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't like Kinugawa, Kotobuki has been taught his whole life that a proper samurai doesn't question the shogunate. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like that one guy you fight in Nobotoke's quest who hates the three sisters but can't do anything about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually prefer Sexua over Kasshin. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it has better distance closing attacks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks man! #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought I had to hit the ceiling, it gives points for whatever reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the MC isn't kinugawa. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's the point.he will gladly break the law if he got nudged in that direction.Nobotoke's guy committed sudoku. #$%
@#$ $#@ which is what kotobuki should've done.fucker didn't even got a death speech on the samurai straight ending.he died like a fucking mook with black bars. #$%
@#$ $#@ even the devs hated him. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I usually did was unsheating my weapon in front of them, a good number would go unarmed against me, much easier than just punching around people. #$%
@#$ $#@ You gotta the the friendly dialog options. #$%
@#$ $#@ something like "i'm your friend", "just to talk", and "what are you going to do now?".It's the only harakiri in the game so maybe you should do it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ on waterwheel and maybe the others too if you time the first press of a right your bar will turn blue and not take any damage for a moment. #$%
@#$ $#@ makes the slower rotations easier #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck do you get that without cheating? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit that insane luck, though tiger claws have the better exclusive move #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't. #$%
@#$ $#@ As far as being a loli, sort of, you can unlock being able to change your height but the proportions are a bit off. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only have this problem with sidequests. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're on normal mode, git gud. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're on hard or harakiri, go back to normal mode and make a style with toughen - expert and make sure your sword is at 500 strength. #$%
@#$ $#@ no but you can make a short female character which is roughly the same size #$%
@#$ $#@ But it is viable, well anything aside from Harakiri. #$%
@#$ $#@ But claws are a weapon #$%
@#$ $#@ unarmed is a style :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ Think so #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought DLC couldn't be refunded if it had been 'consumed' or some shit like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know what most dlcs do in this game, like when they say they add a mission. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean everything in this game is just based on events on certain days, is this dlc adding an actual event or what is going on? #$%
@#$ $#@ By mission it means sidequests, not proper events. #$%
@#$ $#@ op why are you doing this #$%

@#$ $#@ let it die #$%
@#$ $#@ less than 15 minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I highly doubt there are people with codes atm #$%
@#$ $#@ Good idea, you make the new thread, and make sure to start the thread giving away smash, starfox and Mario kart 8 #$%
@#$ $#@ 3dsfag here, I'm beginning to think these fucks are doing some crazy trick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just copy and paste them on a browser. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a trick. #$%
@#$ $#@ HarmoKnight code doesn't seem to work #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a copypaste from earlier in the thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's trying to ruse you. #$%
@#$ $#@ dag, yo #$%
@#$ $#@ Have they done a stage or boss pack or DLC? #$%
@#$ $#@ I am not aware tbh as all I am aware of are the expensive ass costume packs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta make the festival of 150 attendees last as long as possible. #$%

@#$ $#@ i want to be spooning with marie when she do anything #$%
@#$ $#@ space spice #$%
@#$ $#@ Angry Joe. #$%
@#$ $#@ FIREPLACE I WOULD #$%
@#$ $#@ you're a godsend or a devil in disguise, I was looking for autism genre. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember watching that black dude make fun of this guy and guptears in his sonic autism videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's an actual aspy though #$%
@#$ $#@ nothing beats his fan fic about him and his wife reshiram having a conversation about his over-consumption of pokemon feces #$%
@#$ $#@ I think this may be my nostalgia talking but it sure was good at spooking a little me. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was such a weird place with fake walls, an underwater spooky boat ride, and all sorts of torture devices everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're both midis, it's that OOT has better samples. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to hear this guy sing One Winged Angel. #$%
@#$ $#@ This could work as a cross-examination in Ace Attorney #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't hear anything and neither does anyone in the comments so maybe youre just hearing thigs. #$%
@#$ $#@ WoW is a blast. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't ask anyone on /v/ for actual advice though, since everyone who speaks their mind here do so because they have a very polarized opinion about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did the same thing when it came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never looked back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool genre. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same as any other big title. #$%
@#$ $#@ The key to enjoying MMOs is getting into the massively multiplayer aspect. #$%
@#$ $#@ By finding friends in the game can you truly get the most out of the genre. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would have helped if you played them back when playing with someone from across the world was still a marvel of technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember how shit the instances were while grinding. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just made me cringe at the thought #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you get to Heavensward content? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's really bad how they've set everything up to be pretty boring in the beginning, but they ramped up the quality a lot at the point in the MSQ leading up to getting to the new content. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, I wouldn't recommend the game for new players, but it gets a lot better the more you play, which is not necessarily a good thing unfortunately. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neverwinter, favorite MMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ A dude that plays Neverwinter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you want him to suffer through those 60-70 level grind and telling him that PvP is P2W at max level? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Stronghold update is definitely going to emphasize that part. #$%
@#$ $#@ Requesting /ss/ between Nachi and a random shota please. #$%
@#$ $#@ Awesome, was waiting to see the result of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ oops didnt me to reply to the post #$%
@#$ $#@ You're allowed to post a request once each thread friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have to link back to the last thread, that is unless you want to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking noice #$%
@#$ $#@ Pikachu, Pious Augustus, and Kirby #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, they were probably different. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a coincidence that KI was involved with both of them, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna do a better job coloring this, but probably later #$%
@#$ $#@ with her penis right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga that's cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ what is that screen from? #$%
@#$ $#@ Baker pls go #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck yes, seconding #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm looking for a fuck everywhere but I can't find one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm looking for your delivery, but it looks like it's not coming. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yet another instance where fucks are in short supply. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you turned on by that ugly thing with clashing clothes? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a big thing for a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think they're cute but it's not good to overdo things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rozalin and Etna #$%
@#$ $#@ here ... #$%

@#$ $#@ Thanks a bunch!! #$%
@#$ $#@ Too scary! #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get this feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you get something great, why not share it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, but if it's vanilla enough, you could try /h/ as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's probably furry #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause he paid for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he shared it, that means everyone gets it for free except for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow thats very accurate to how i imagined it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also thanks for taking the request this ones hilariously cute and lewd. #$%
@#$ $#@ But it doesn't make it any less valuable for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I could buy a game and also give everyone else that same game for free, I'd do it 10 times out of 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ but i paid for this, why should you fucks get it for free? #$%
@#$ $#@ and the artist is getting money for it so they can't complain either #$%
@#$ $#@ 11/10 will fap to #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, fair enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ No need to continue talking about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Torpedo tits the origin #$%

@#$ $#@ sweet, thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ What's up? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing, nothing at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why do you post such a sad sonic? #$%

@#$ $#@ Cooking !! #$%
@#$ $#@ Who might those be? #$%
@#$ $#@ the why not both #$%
@#$ $#@ We answered last time, disgusting cow tits. #$%

@#$ $#@ When I said INB4, I meant I hope this guy doesn't show up. #$%
@#$ $#@ You then showed up and i'm giving you that Sonic reaction when you responded to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you hope someone doesn't show up? #$%
@#$ $#@ I do something to you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus dude, no need to lose your bottom over this. #$%
@#$ $#@ sorry ... #$%

@#$ $#@ Why are you being dense on purpose? #$%
@#$ $#@ not OR but very nice! #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it rude of me to ask why? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wondering, since i seem to get this same remark every so often. #$%

@#$ $#@ if you could cite me to them i;m willing to wait, i don't mind honestly #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want a drawing from someone else cause I want a different art style is all. #$%
@#$ $#@ It took me a while to get used to mine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think that's just true for any new tool you're gonna use though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ultimate solution, get a tablet with its own screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember a long time ago, you drew some Midna facesitting anon, could you do something like that again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I absolutely love facesitting. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about Felicia face-sitting on anon, cowgirl-style? #$%
@#$ $#@ Definitely takes some getting used to it and while I do traditional as well, if I wasn't actively enrolled in classes for traditional, I wouldn't go back after using a tablet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now if only I could afford a Cintiq. #$%

@#$ $#@ Yeah I'm here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I think it looks great. #$%
@#$ $#@ My only nitpick would be that I can't tell if it's a walk animation or her swaying her hips and putting an arm on each side. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regardless thanks so much for doing it. #$%

@#$ $#@ I didn't want it to be obvious whether it was a walk or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's how Earthbound characters are. #$%

@#$ $#@ Mitsuru is way too naive. #$%
@#$ $#@ She could be tricked into fucking some other dude with ease. #$%
@#$ $#@ people find charm in her innocence I guess #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd believe in the naive thing, but the rich couples part means i would be included, as long as i got some pussy of another rich ho i could deal #$%

@#$ $#@ Fuuka on the other hand just seems to go about her normal routine after he dies despite having the most normal life of the members of SEES. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop posting, Adachi. #$%

@#$ $#@ what does the diamond do? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you mean RGN. #$%
@#$ $#@ He needed more money to A+ the money grade and he was teleporting back to entrance and the audience kept shouting "GOLD DIAMOND" and he didn't hear them so he continued to teleport until it was too late then he realized what happened #$%

@#$ $#@ Missed a diamond that was essential to A rank #$%
@#$ $#@ It's worth 20 mil. #$%

@#$ $#@ kills me when one of them says "ya'll" #$%
@#$ $#@ He didn't call anyone that, he just said "Fucking niggers". #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, did he really get banned for that? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was after everything was over and no one was even watching. #$%

@#$ $#@ that happened two years ago you fucking retard, he was at agdq15 #$%

@#$ $#@ This shit sounds too retarded to be true. #$%

@#$ $#@ Weak bait #$%
@#$ $#@ That's Carthage city level though once you upgrade it or play the Carthage custom map it looks a lot better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 was still shit type but after how good Attila ended up I'm liking forward to warhammer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Historically roman troops regularly got slaughtered by the inhabitants of the cities they occupied though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its still a dumb mechanic though because legions would usually build their bases near cities anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Attila's probably the best in the series gameplay wise too #$%
@#$ $#@ did they confirm that? #$%
@#$ $#@ because in the demo the giant and spider animations have them decapitating imperial soldiers #$%
@#$ $#@ Their games are solid with the exception of empire. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, we know we're getting humans, orcs, dwarves, and vampire counts, so that's at least two more factions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Avatar conquest was fucking shite and a waste of everyone's time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Napoleon and Shogun 2/Fall of the Samurai are generally considered to be decent purchases if you can put up with a slight lack of unit diversity in Shogun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Medieval 2Kingdoms, it's best just to grab both has the best and most overhaul mods out of any and I personally enjoy the vanilla campaign in it as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 1 shows its age but remains fun for the most part. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd only recommend Rome 2 if you enjoy every other TW game and Attila still has the problem of samey factions #$%
@#$ $#@ Assuming it follows the Rome 2 handled things: several flavors of Empire, several ork factions and of course all the flavors of Chaos. #$%
@#$ $#@ And the ones you mentioned. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be shocked if Skaven and Lizardmen aren't DLC. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want muh Tomb Kings #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as the content is abundant enough it sounds fine to me, also they said that each expansion will actually add onto the main game's campaign map, so the map will expand south into araby, east into badlands etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least you can use DLC assets w/o buying the DLC with CA. #$%
@#$ $#@ Found the battle list baby #$%
@#$ $#@ Grinding for units is for queers. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be cool if they allowed us to grind for heroes/army painter features in multiplayer #$%
@#$ $#@ Badlands is south too, east is the Dark Lands i.e. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chaos Dorf territory #$%
@#$ $#@ Still feels lifeless, the faction system went from being a literally useless to being only 90% a waste of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ theoretically, TW:WH will have actual magic units in it, and flying units. #$%
@#$ $#@ iktf anon #$%
@#$ $#@ enjoy losing half your armies because you didn't balance your chosen family's power #$%
@#$ $#@ He's right that Rome 2's campaign is kinda bland. #$%
@#$ $#@ They made it a lot better in Attila with the Family tree and governor system. #$%
@#$ $#@ They also fixed the civil war system and the AI is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ just like dawn of war #$%
@#$ $#@ I added the theoretically because /v/ will just say that they will remove everything and downgrade everything they see good in a trailer. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wouldn't work with how battles work I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean marching would take way too long and TW doesn't go for that same audience. #$%
@#$ $#@ It can go either way, and in GW's universe it's 'dwarfs' #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally none of the retarded design decisions on that tedious grind of a campaign map were fixed, or even substantially altered, apart from some admittedly welcome but nonetheless largely cosmetic changes to colours, UI and art assets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2's campaign gameplay is by far the worst of the series, I just can't bring myself to play it for more than about an hour before I shut it down. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll look into getting Shogun 2 or Medieval 2 when they hit a sale, thanks anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Retribution never happened anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not the previous anon, but I think you should get Rome 1 as well, unless you're a massive historical accuracy autist in which case you should still get it and just download EB1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Along with Medieval 1, I think it's the tightest in the series in terms of how the battles "feel". #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark omen did it right. #$%
@#$ $#@ From what I remember of an earlier interview, maps have randomized areas where magic works or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is no way to make magic in Warhammer balanced in this style of combat #$%
@#$ $#@ Id agree with you if RotDG wasn't so fucking crash-ridden. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've yet to play a campaign where the game didn't start crashing every end of turn after around turn 80. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, just like I can call you grack, when its greg. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a shame anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I managed to get three campaigns to on hundred or so turns without many ctds. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am sure you know how 2 flying monsters attack each other in real time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why don't you offer CA your expert help, and give us some sneak peaks while you are at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just go outside and find two birds going at each other. #$%
@#$ $#@ he wants more spice muhreens #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently he wanted a 40k game - a platoon/company level game - from a developer who almost exclusively make large-scale melees #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't have to know how giant flying monsters fight each other to be disappointed that in this game they're stuck on a very low altitude and hover like drones #$%
@#$ $#@ No problem Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd recommend trying Napoleon as well, mainly because it's got some GOAT mp if you can find a game #$%
@#$ $#@ Aight, I'll have a look into that too. #$%
@#$ $#@ ur an idiot LOL #$%
@#$ $#@ well shit ill have to try this. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has to come from big armies because an AI can always be learned. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being numerically outmatched is one of the few ways to redress that balance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alex was like a mini Rome 2, in it had little atmosphere or flavour. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I liked about BI was that all the new mechanics fording, religion, schiltron, night battles, hordes seemed to have been designed in service to the time period, not the other way round. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern total war games commit the grave sin of keeping mechanics around simply because the code is there, with no thought to redefining them for the era see: diplomacy and technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not the guy you're replying to, but how did you come up with that conclusion? #$%
@#$ $#@ Genuinely curious, because it's so illogical. #$%
@#$ $#@ LOTR is for adults. #$%
@#$ $#@ Warhammer is for children. #$%
@#$ $#@ Deal with that cold hard fact, nerd. #$%
@#$ $#@ LOTR has simply too good of a story to translate into total war games well. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt a problem in early rome 2 because all units mashed together. #$%
@#$ $#@ But then CA went overboard with the fix and made it so every unit acted like trained legionaries even when formation was toggled off. #$%
@#$ $#@ The mod for Medieval 2 did it pretty well. #$%
@#$ $#@ But LOTR is aimed at adults. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Hobbit is aimed at children, but the LOTR trilogy is definitely an adult-oriented story that children would not understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think your 8 year old stuff understood it at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ You probably understood the basic premise, but many of the themes and subtleties likely flew over your head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing about the Warscape engine in conducive to melee combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've reread the trilogy twice since then and I gained no new insights. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could you be more specific? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not particularly well versed in the architecture of game engines and am curious as to where such an obvious pitfall lies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unit movement, specifically the way individual soldiers move and engage in combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the fact that attacking and defending is tied to animations, instead of unit stats. #$%
@#$ $#@ Notice the way soldiers dance around each other without a care for the issuing melee around them. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one has any idea what they talk about. #$%
@#$ $#@ They will just post the arguments they have heard before. #$%
@#$ $#@ This, and its been in games for decades- e.g. #$%
@#$ $#@ sim cities army bases increases crime around it- soldiers cant stop ladding about #$%
@#$ $#@ Mad that it was made by russians? #$%
@#$ $#@ So, that's the reason why it's so shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ overly bloated scripts is why it is so shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its partially true. #$%
@#$ $#@ all right I'll look for a decent torrent #$%
@#$ $#@ they added anime tier combat into shogun 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ people praise shogun 2 for its flashy animation and long drawn out duels, but say the same is bad for rome2. #$%
@#$ $#@ The thing is you can kind of take Shogun as one of those classic samurai movies. #$%
@#$ $#@ The combat works well within that theme. #$%
@#$ $#@ It started with Medieval 2 if you want to be anal, but it was only a minor problem in S2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just got much worse in the successive games. #$%
@#$ $#@ We wouldn't be on 4chan if we did. #$%
@#$ $#@ No actually Im pretty hype for 1.6 #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, I didn't play the America's campaign much. #$%
@#$ $#@ I used conquistadors in custom battles and never ran into that, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, it is far harder to find people who excel with the falx or the falcata, as it is to find people who practice real martial arts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit like this makes it so i dont even bother repositioning musket troops. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just let them fire until the enemy smashes into them and hope that once they rout there's still enough that the unit isnt destroyed. #$%
@#$ $#@ shogun 2 is a fine entry point. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's probably the most balanced game although realm divide is completely bonkers for new players. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only one thing worse than Warscape melee combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ And that is the older engines handling of firearms. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 isn't just 1v1 animations though. #$%
@#$ $#@ They added generic swings like RTW and M2 and expanded on this with Attila. #$%
@#$ $#@ In attila they changed the matched combat the 1v1 duel animations to be shorter chained sequences that could be interruptible so that there's less dueling and more group fighting. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like they're expanding on this even more with Warhammer. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're the one who doesn't understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Animations have absolutely nothing to do with how the combat works. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can in fact disable or increase the amount ofl the locked-on animations with mods, combat still moves at the same pace. #$%
@#$ $#@ Warscape melee combat is fine though. #$%
@#$ $#@ In medieval 2 all two handed units underperform because they can be stunlocked to death by sword and shield units. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pikes are also totally broken in M2. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is fixed in warscape engine games. #$%
@#$ $#@ stop being such a fucking fedora tipper. #$%
@#$ $#@ fots was fine and they did a good job with the guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ No they've been in since launch. #$%
@#$ $#@ You judt didn't see them often until they turned down the amount of matched combat in the later patches so that there was less dueling out of formation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Warhammer looks like splash attacks are a big deal with agent/heroes and some units like the trolls. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is just so much shit going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, due to the long ass combat system, you had all those unit collision memers jump aboard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The system under the hood is superior. #$%
@#$ $#@ The animations don't actually affect the battle mechanics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well seeing as how hes posting the truth I'd say he fits in more than a meta contraction like yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whoa where did this gameplay footage come from? #$%
@#$ $#@ age of smegma #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure the only thing they've said is that it's before the end times. #$%
@#$ $#@ world campaign is the only way and mp is for faggots so yes you'll be able to enjoy sp if you're not a faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is the soldiers on the left doing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit talking? #$%
@#$ $#@ The system isn't superior at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's simply more complicated while being simultaneously providing less nuanced gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Complexity =/= depth #$%
@#$ $#@ Thunka van Thunk is busy working on a 40k MOBA sorry fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sad when Viking Conquest has a more fitting soundtrack than a Triple AAA exclusive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Viking Conquest is shit bro #$%
@#$ $#@ It's hard to get everyone in frame to look like they're doing something in Rome 2 and Attila compared to Shogun 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ It is, just like With Fire and Sword. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the soundtrack is still better than Rome 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well of course its hard when most of them aren't doing anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's way easier IMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ Units in S2 have very few facial expressions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much all they can do is open their mouth and blink #$%
@#$ $#@ That guy on the left isn't even fucking touching his weapon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just floating between his hands. #$%
@#$ $#@ I recommend Fall of the Samurai #$%
@#$ $#@ Who gives a single fuck about Kislev? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those pussies got wiped out early anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't you know, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Seinfeld isn't funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who cares about facial expressions? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that question meant to be rhetorical? #$%
@#$ $#@ how old is your machine ffs? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're right, but in terms of animations I think S2 was a lot more dynamic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even the idle animations always looked like they were doing something, or about to #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the vomit animation personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Problem is that while CK2 has great grand strategy, it's handling of actual warfare and battles is a sidenote. #$%
@#$ $#@ And for a setting like Warhammer you really want the war and battle mechanics to be at the focus #$%
@#$ $#@ I expect the battles to be the main focus in a total war game. #$%
@#$ $#@ except for the last 6 years all we've got is GRAPHICS and increasingly bloated ultimately vestigial campaign "improvements". #$%
@#$ $#@ that fucking lag at speed 4 and 5 though #$%
@#$ $#@ Let's be honest lad you can't be elitist when you play CK2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you watch the fucking trailer? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can literally interpret it that way but in my mind its more of a figuratively littorical question #$%
@#$ $#@ I like it #$%
@#$ $#@ It's different. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally I like it a lot better, I know S2's was stylized on purpose but it didn't need to be like that, and it just kind of hurt the effect in the long run. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Attila added a system where you can draw a path on the ground and the selected unit would follow it? #$%
@#$ $#@ What more do you need? #$%
@#$ $#@ wires tapping into your brain to telepathically having your soldiers follow your orders? #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 has some pretty good animations #$%
@#$ $#@ It's amazing that CA shills literally lack the imagination to figure out what we could possibly need beyond the ability to draw a fucking path. #$%
@#$ $#@ They can. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 has the issue of the matched combat animations being really long so they don't attack him during these execution animations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Medieval 2 actually has the same problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ wow, physics sure did work differently in 19th century Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, because interactive movies where you think the battle and watch the AI execute it is far better. #$%
@#$ $#@ They actually do attack them from the rear sometimes #$%
@#$ $#@ Also before anyone comments, they were in guard mode which is why they're not surrounding him and are staying in formation. #$%
@#$ $#@ It never gets old #$%
@#$ $#@ That looks like tracer gunfire #$%
@#$ $#@ They're heavy gunners. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yeah Shogun 2 is not realistic in any way but it's satisfying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this garry's mod? #$%
@#$ $#@ All the assets ended up ingame. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just couldn't actually run the game on any of the settings to see them at launch. #$%
@#$ $#@ what fucking units are these #$%
@#$ $#@ weeb castle garrison samurai. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like the unique hojo rocket units #$%
@#$ $#@ They're the rocket units. #$%
@#$ $#@ The unit getting shot up is the Onna Bushi hero unit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will make them soontm. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to make a mod for an all girls unit and I need to make a unit with a single soldier to fight them with for the animations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where the fuck did you get Bretonnia and Kislev from? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is it about needing to broadcast your fucking hobby everywhere like an attention seeking whore every minute? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're not special. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smoking weed is degenerate. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are worse than furries #$%
@#$ $#@ they are bullied rejects and have autism. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's really all it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ neo /v/ is cancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ all the oldfags i still play vidya with are stoners. #$%
@#$ $#@ these kids are ridiculous. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much. #$%

@#$ $#@ come on dude, why can't you just let us be? #$%
@#$ $#@ why arent we allowed to have our own thread, why does it bother you? #$%
@#$ $#@ why can't you just hide and ignore? #$%
@#$ $#@ all degenerates deserve the same treatment #$%
@#$ $#@ XD DUDE DRUGS HAHAHAHA #$%
@#$ $#@ So is playing video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I don't see em here. #$%
@#$ $#@ why are dispensaries always so shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ swear to god half of them are ALWAYS trying to fuck with you or rip you off. #$%

@#$ $#@ Why does it look like moldy old dried up shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why can't you just stick to /b/? #$%
@#$ $#@ i really never got to play much more than smt 4, because ive never been able to have money at the time i see these games. #$%
@#$ $#@ are they worth the hunt tho? #$%
@#$ $#@ like, i know p3 is, but not sure bout the others #$%
@#$ $#@ i really never got to play much more than smt 4, because ive never been able to have money at the time i see these games. #$%
@#$ $#@ are they worth the hunt tho? #$%
@#$ $#@ like, i know p3 is, but not sure bout the others yo #$%
@#$ $#@ How the hell is SMT fujo shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Last mainline was pretty great and had no pandering. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMTIV was fujotrash. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see that scene as just silly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you are just seeing things where they aren't. #$%
@#$ $#@ kek, i got chaos first time around but fucked up and black hole'd that shit #$%
@#$ $#@ that's literally the only fuckin scene in the game where the characters are like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ anon is stupid, couldnt have it any other way :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ so like, do the games tie together in a way? #$%
@#$ $#@ again, ive played like, one smt game and one persona game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only ones that have any major connections are the DDS duology and the Persona 2 duology. #$%
@#$ $#@ The rest can be played in almost any order. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have not played the Raidou games, but are they related to the older Devil Summoner games on Sega Saturn? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know much about the sega saturn games but I don't think so #$%
@#$ $#@ There are character's named Kuzunoha Kyouji for the Saturn game and Raidou for the two PS2 games. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's mainly it #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, I'd SMT 4 any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've heard mixed opinions. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a little disappointing in some areas, especially the dungeons. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Incredible soundtrack, cool setting, lots of demons, pretty much everything you want from SMT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mainline SMT is dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ New FE crossover killed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's ok really. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would have been 10 times better on a real console. #$%
@#$ $#@ its much more like SMT 1 and 2 then 3 which I think turned a lot of people off, but yeah its okay #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll pick it up sometime soon then. #$%
@#$ $#@ The world map in particular reminded me of SMT 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's a cool throwback. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've also never played Nocturne so it didn't bother me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never played the ps2 SMT or Persona games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only Persona game I've played is p3p and I really liked it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure I'll enjoy it a lot anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never played any other mainline smt game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the archangel designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were fucked up, just like most law-affiliated individuals. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll play the console version when I manage to pick up the console. #$%
@#$ $#@ I heard portable takes away quite a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll admit that /smtg/ had a little breakdown over that fucking awful disappointment, but I believe Atlus will make another mainline one day. #$%
@#$ $#@ They made Catherine after all, so I still believe they'll take a risk now and again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 5 will probably sell a lot of copies as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd like a new Raidou, personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing has ever made me put a game down. #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe in myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, maybe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Girls seem to think I'm really funny, so either I'm a really funny guy, or they think I'm cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fat chicks have unrealistic expectations, she'd never settle for a /v/irgin #$%
@#$ $#@ the KS grils? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey Boco? #$%
@#$ $#@ Drive forms back #$%

@#$ $#@ star wars and the avengers #$%
@#$ $#@ Treasure Planet faggotry and Spiderman would be neat #$%
@#$ $#@ Is thinking that Disney isn't the best part of Kingdom Hearts a real opinion? #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you actually played KH2 recently? #$%
@#$ $#@ The first half of the game is extremely tedious and dull, you don't have enough moves to do anything interesting in combat and the worlds are all boring standard Disney filler #$%
@#$ $#@ Lightning and Frozen. #$%
@#$ $#@ KH2 was trash for focusing on the OC anime characters over the Disney worlds, you're right #$%
@#$ $#@ Nomura has basically said that he's open to the idea, very open. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Disney worlds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mulan was the most boring shit imaginable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Another musical world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong game, mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want that, you might try another game. #$%
@#$ $#@ They only got Kairi, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mickey and Riku disappear again almost immediately after being found. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of them look fucking gay except for the Snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could have sworn that I've seen an interview that said when it comes to what's actually in the games Nomura and his team aren't really pressured by Disney, it's just when they ask about certain elements when it comes to how characters or intellectual properties are used that's when Disney will come in to give the green light or reject it. #$%
@#$ $#@ ...So what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nomura has said that they've been able to see films before they come out. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought that was just an NPC #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe she's a secondary character like Erinn was in IX. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I just assumed she was an important NPC which is why she's a bit more detailed than a generic NPC #$%
@#$ $#@ These girls are from DQ? #$%

@#$ $#@ Well if the pop is low then yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'll be hard to find people who want to level with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially since this is a normal xp rate server... #$%
@#$ $#@ BLU is being fixed currently, and SMN works fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is This before RNG sidewinder got nerfed? #$%
@#$ $#@ There are always people expng. #$%
@#$ $#@ level sync allows this, and also help the community interact more tbh without level sync it would be impossible to exp well. #$%
@#$ $#@ but you can get 75 in a month or weeks if you really wanted #$%
@#$ $#@ It is on private servers because it's coded badly #$%
@#$ $#@ No one is really going to want to level sync unless it's a prime grinding spot. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's based on post-2h buff formulae for the most part. #$%
@#$ $#@ XI without endgame is just grinding for bragging rights, and basically becomes cookie clicker with an exp bar. #$%
@#$ $#@ If these are truly issues with this particular server, some anons are gonna be quite pissed if they last the full 1-3 months it will take to 75 their first job with base exp rates. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you autistic? #$%
@#$ $#@ What's with all the nonsensical irrelevant meme spouting? #$%
@#$ $#@ The boon was that they did not need to auto-attack to gain TP. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you did not know the monster you were attacking got whatever TP you got+#, and would use a skill of its own when it reached 300%. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you had people attacking it to build TP, it would use skills nonstop. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could use SMN as your only DPS, attacking once per minute, and have the mob do almost nothing but auto-attacks. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's torrents around #$%
@#$ $#@ True, but the physical BPs still generated TP for the mobs if I'm not mistaken, and the magic based moves were actually reliant upon the pet TP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been ages since then, but I think it was mostly better to use a BLM or two outside of enmity issues that could crop up. #$%
@#$ $#@ nasomi is free retail is not #$%
@#$ $#@ The combat style is better than your WoW shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ What other combat styles are you suggesting we play then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Black Desert action combat? #$%
@#$ $#@ FFXIV wannabe WoW combat? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it Maha? #$%
@#$ $#@ This intense autism reminds me of Maha. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never heard of him, but sounds like a real retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's Natenn. #$%
@#$ $#@ He ended up getting an apoc during WoTG #$%
@#$ $#@ bst works fine, like somone saida while back blue is being fixed #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you even know what FFXI is? #$%
@#$ $#@ So far you've showed that you didn't and you're just spewing buzzwords and shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm ready for some more mithra butt. #$%
@#$ $#@ US though i get a great connection from EU #$%
@#$ $#@ oi m8 ive played this server for 21 days straight and it hasn't crashed once so go take a seat #$%
@#$ $#@ Not much to really talk about unless we get a large group of people playing this. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMN was always bad, sadly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would call it my main, but for LS purposes I was WHM and SCH. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just wasn't good, even when you're geared too the fucking teeth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldn't get myera.is to work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna try this in a bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been missing this a lot lately. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember all of these things except only charging 750g for a tele. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anywhere from 1-5k, but never anything less. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember going into a new zone for the first time and letting the music smack you in the face, what a feeling that was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst I've seen is just some guys ERPing in town near an AH. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not as good as some dude mistyping and embarrassing themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly after playing modern FFXI I doubt I could play on a private server. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, old FFXI is probably a better game, but I don't have time for it anymore and the convenient shit they added is just too nice #$%
@#$ $#@ said, it's hard to get back into without a group of people to play it with. #$%
@#$ $#@ 7 dollars on ebay #$%
@#$ $#@ the adapter works i have proved it with my pc #$%
@#$ $#@ let me try it right now #$%
@#$ $#@ That's because a PC is capable of producing 31khz RGB. #$%
@#$ $#@ PS4 has no RGB or YPbPr output. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless I'm mistaken. #$%
@#$ $#@ See above. #$%
@#$ $#@ that would be so tryhard #$%
@#$ $#@ my picks were simon belmont&gt;toon zelda/tetra&gt;lloyd irving. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you honestly think he'll get a mii suit and they'll put him in? #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet they've already started working on the models and animations of the poll's "winner" so they can release it right when the results are announced, to cash in on maximum hype. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing as how Castlevania is going to have a new official erotic pachinko machine, I don't think a Belmont will get in. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they did that, it would be PR suicide. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone would know that character was worked on before the poll was finished because it's obviously impossible to produce a completed character as soon as the results are in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hello, Patternfag. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he isn't I doubt it will be because someone on the team said "Hey lets add Protoman!"and someone else mournfully responded "Well we would, but he's already a Mii costume so tough shit." #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like you have autism. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called "cashing in" you fucking idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are people who would gladly buy both K. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rool and a Mii costume of him, same way people would gladly buy cosmetic Mii DLC of characters that are already in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes all ssb4 needs is generic pretty swordsmen with similar movesets! #$%
@#$ $#@ Who the fuck is Lloyd? #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be intentionally dense. #$%
@#$ $#@ a damn good barrista. #$%
@#$ $#@ sure, and roy and lucina could've had completely separate movesets from marth, but they did't. #$%
@#$ $#@ what makes you think they wouldn't do the same for lloyd #$%
@#$ $#@ i mean yeah, but sakurai doesnt want more sword dudes. #$%
@#$ $#@ too many clones already #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 clones of marth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lie and tell everybody that there are 69 clones. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will be funnier. #$%
@#$ $#@ They literally helped make both versions of Sm4sh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Symphonia started on the Gamecube and Bamco co-developed Smash Pac-Man #$%
@#$ $#@ And yet Pac Land has no music from its source game, Pac Man World is unrepresented, and Pac Man himself is fucking Namco Museum instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not 2007 anymore, be happy he got a costume at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ enjoy your robin clone #$%
@#$ $#@ You people have the weirdest expectation when it comes to Smash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yet those "deconfirmed" characters did eventually make it in despite the "deconfirmations"? #$%
@#$ $#@ What point are you arguing here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dunban uses the wrong arm in his costume iirc #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't bother, these people think anyone that isn't their pick will be a clone. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd personally trade Lucina for him if it men't we were getting a new villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, he was my number one pick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had no idea there was really that much demand for him to be in the game anyways, but I'm really glad that there apparently was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best outfit in this whole set and I'm happy to see any content being made to respect best Fire Emblem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo Direct when? #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, they should be voting for the real heavy hitters like bandanna waddle dee, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh shut the fuck up, Oakland. #$%
@#$ $#@ He never farted on anyone until Next Level and Sakurai got their hands on him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting drunk is in no way comparable to that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll take Nintendo Minute and like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sheelloyd did happen thanks to multiple realities that are no different from choosing a different dialogue option. #$%
@#$ $#@ Take solace in that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted him in, although he wasn't that high on my list. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least I was able to recreate the moveset I had for him in ToS except for Double Demon Fang. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't expecting to see Lloyd in Smash at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad his outfit got in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, seriously? #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't they say a big update was coming? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but wasn't that just the Splatoon thing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless they also wan to reveal that new lootcrate thing in august. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres that at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sheena would have made a nice close range "fist" fighter. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game is fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rise eats pussy? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to play Rise's game #$%
@#$ $#@ is this from a Gallardo Del Tomba movie? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's official, sun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently this is called a 'High-cut Armor' which is available in game. #$%
@#$ $#@ blame SMTfags #$%
@#$ $#@ They gave that up when it was no longer profitable. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's from Dancing All Night. #$%
@#$ $#@ nothing, i'm just saying you're fooling yourself if you think it's in any way dignified #$%
@#$ $#@ Do SMT fags even talk about the games at all? #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time I see a Nocturne thread they just seem to talk about how much they hate persona. #$%
@#$ $#@ they decided high cut armor in p4 was stupid compared to p3 battle panties/high cut armor #$%
@#$ $#@ My fucking dick #$%
@#$ $#@ spin-off games like DAN and Q aren't canon #$%
@#$ $#@ Love that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Played the shit out of it on a rental from Blockbuster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever you have to tell yourself bud. #$%
@#$ $#@ Surprisingly enough Dancing All Night is canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a dancer constume for Rise, who is a pop idol, in a game that's about dancing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't that appropriate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe the issue is she's not showing enough skin? #$%
@#$ $#@ they all are #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a hypersexualized belly dancer costume worn by an underage girl while she makes cunnilingus gestures with her fingers. #$%
@#$ $#@ so nothing wrong with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ They haven't had it for years bub. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tell the police that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I'll tell the thought police right away, sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where the hell is Kaneko these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't that legal in Japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ she's not American #$%
@#$ $#@ Out in the boonies hiding from Atlus lest they force him to work on their games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, muricunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ 16 is legal almost everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ the funny thing is, age of consent in america is not 18 except california. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's 16 on average. #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on the state #$%
@#$ $#@ What time period are you from? #$%
@#$ $#@ I might buy this game now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Working on enemy designs for senran kagura #$%
@#$ $#@ the senrans may have ridiculously large breasts, but they are at least placed on the torso properly and seem to obey gravity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck I thought we would get away without her being in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ enjoy your granny panties #$%
@#$ $#@ The only crime is that this isn't Naoto's high cut armour. #$%
@#$ $#@ We would just have a different cultural stereotype for them, like maybe a Japanese dancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Marie has the best design and she's a good character in Japanese. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just the english version that ruins her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to lick Marie's crusty, unwiped, filthy anus! #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to wipe her clean with my tongue and taste her deliciousness while twisting her nipples as she reads me her poetry and fingers herself! #$%
@#$ $#@ you will never leave #$%
@#$ $#@ even Falcom is all about jap high schoolers nowadays #$%
@#$ $#@ Gay trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even Americans agree with that, there are states with 16 as the age of consent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only ten states out of 50 ever go so far as having it be eighteen. #$%
@#$ $#@ mariefags are the worst #$%
@#$ $#@ actually in Florida, age of consent varies on your age. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're 18-23, 16+17 year olds are A-OK #$%
@#$ $#@ This tbqh #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a persona fan who is also hyped for kowashitai #$%
@#$ $#@ Waifus saved the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you on about? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, why isn't DAN on there? #$%
@#$ $#@ It should definitely be in the Hyped category. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's an armor i can stand behind #$%
@#$ $#@ Quick, who's the artist that did that Marie doijin that draws the stickiest, most delicious looking cum known to mankind? #$%
@#$ $#@ I forget his name, I only have this from the same artist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I can't be hyped for what I am currently playing #$%
@#$ $#@ DUDE BOOBS LMAO #$%
@#$ $#@ Terrible taste detected. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the point of that picture isn't waifu-faggotry but the trash that Atlus has pumped out courtesy of P4 with DAN being the epitome of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus P3 hasn't been degraded into a dancing game....... #$%
@#$ $#@ yet, but if and when it does I'll make sure to add it to the bin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop making me want to import it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is so not official. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember Me's combat was fucking atrocious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Life is Strange is literally Remember Me: Walking Simulator Edition. #$%
@#$ $#@ Draw your own conclusions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both are shit, Remember Me was an utterly forgettable action game with a terrible system, Life is Strange is a rejected young adult's modern fantasy novel with a shitty unlikable cast, stupid, moronic and horribly out of date dialogue with the thinnest smokescreen for it with "that's how teenagers act", even though its blatantly obvious its a bunch of old French farts trying to write young, American teenagers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sweet me-me arrows, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially love the part where you didn't refute anything and instead decided what /v/ really needed at the moment was another worthless shitpost. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe next time you think about posting you could save us all the trouble of reading your bullshit and just run your fingers through a table saw. #$%
@#$ $#@ top kek #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong, they're both utter shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go play Generic Hipster movie: The Game: SJW edition you flaming fucking faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish it was open world so you could actually explore it. #$%
@#$ $#@ i will, meanwhile enjoy fuming in rage :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ I ignored OP's pic and focused on what they wrote. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise, like everyone else, no one actually answers the question and just calls one or the other game shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess the similarities start and end at the build your combo chain menu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well memed my friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should visit the epic subreddit for life is strange, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ not him, you know what ? #$%
@#$ $#@ you're pretty good, you're right. #$%
@#$ $#@ hotdogs of course #$%
@#$ $#@ wait til you get stuck in B zone #$%
@#$ $#@ Finally made it to rank -B at 38 get stuck with a new team they spend the match camping instead of trying to go for the area 3 matches later down 30 points I don't want to go back to C you guys I-I just can't. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok op I shall help ye. #$%
@#$ $#@ I already did. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Eliwood... #$%
@#$ $#@ The people who didn't buy the Tellius games would be the ones who almost killed FE though #$%
@#$ $#@ Which version? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow dragon almost killed fire emblem you turd #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean Reddit the character? #$%
@#$ $#@ Married Tharja, best eugenic daughter, sniping with spells. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best looking classes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I started a Lunatic save file in Awakening the other day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus Christ, when people called it Frederick Emblem, they weren't kidding. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every other unit tears like tissue paper. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea who any of these characters are but I hope they have well written supports and good personalities. #$%
@#$ $#@ everyone below was tied with each other since I don't care enough about them #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally a cuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've only played three games so far but it seems that the green knight tends to be better than the red knight. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Sain, Oscar and Stahl. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that, having already played through Normal and Hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ But he's fucking mandatory to get anywhere in Lunatic, at least in the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ You definitely want to second seal him as soon as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ He gains levels terribly slowly as a paladin at that point in the game, but stick him back into knight or cavalry and his high stats will still carry over. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shanna was definitely shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shame since I wanted to pair her with Deke.. #$%
@#$ $#@ People on streams tested pairing Nyx and Zero and Eponine had Spellcaster in addition to Outlaw and Dark Mage Nyx's alternate class is Outlaw. #$%
@#$ $#@ Owain is best husbando if he's not already your kid, plus you can marry him twice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lyndis is a goddamn whore. #$%
@#$ $#@ RD killed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ SD was an attempt at pandering to nostalgiafags to try and save it, but also failed. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm at ch 15 and I haven't been using him at all recently. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's only god-tier until you get Lon'qu, then you pretty much don't need any other units. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh and I reclassed Gaius into a Myrmidon and then upgraded him, so that helped too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish there was a way to know how the skills got passed down without having to look it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's annoying that that mechanic doesn't get explained in-game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Replace Rinka with Effie, an actually strong girl who doesn't paint her abs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will most likely update the list once I get my hands on fates, but Camilla is my favorite. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh and Thani targets res, letting Micaiah oneshot niggers all day erryday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Subject to change after I actually play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Awakening is a turd tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're also a dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Posting this just to annoy you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Donnel is better for Sully imo #$%
@#$ $#@ Only reason to ever use Conquest is if you have only 5 skills to choose from. #$%
@#$ $#@ Olivia or Cherche #$%
@#$ $#@ Defeat him with Chrom. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess I'll go Cherche, since I like Olivia with Vaike. #$%
@#$ $#@ Virion should go with Olivia or Cherche. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stahl shoud go with Cordelia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon plz, that's outdated as shit and inaccurate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, if I could find a script, I would bring you all the lines about how Kris is told to "tear down Generals" with his "overwhelming strength". #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh I was just pointing out that she has a really shitty support with Kamui so I dunno why anyone would ever marry her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like her support with some of her other siblings and Hinoka. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ryouma's is good too iirc #$%
@#$ $#@ Jeigan tells Chris once hey you are pretty strong, so that makes him a bigger Mary Sue than the time travelling chosen one, also you are wrong about everything gameplay related. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, you are very convincing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I said I wasn't sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know he has a good support with one of the Nohr girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ girl reporting #$%
@#$ $#@ Joker is basically male tharja #$%
@#$ $#@ AS YOU SEE I'VE GOT BICEPS TO SPARE #$%
@#$ $#@ My taste is the best #$%
@#$ $#@ Her supports with Zero and Silas give insight into why she is the way she is about Kamui, especially Zero's. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also all of the Nohr siblings fucking adore Kamui. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lilith could use more love, but that is just me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good list overall. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Lilith enough but I wish she did more in the story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really that goes for a lot of characters who aren't named Aqua. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's cute but that expression on her face right there doesn't help her out. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Lucina is the Lucario of Fire Emblem, than Aqua is the Zoroark of Fire Emblem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention a terrible tactician which no one should listen to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aqua doesn't really do shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ She just provides exposition. #$%
@#$ $#@ And in the hoshido and nohr routes really just teasing the third route #$%
@#$ $#@ Aqua is definitely Lucario, especially considering that for all of their pushing her, she isn't nearly as popular as she probably should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is, but she's DLC apparently. #$%
@#$ $#@ /feg/ doesn't know how to get her and they've datamined the fuck out of the game since before it was officially out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Swap gregor and kellam #$%
@#$ $#@ The art style of Federation Force is Miis, so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ so even if it was equal or greater to Prime or Super Metroid, you wouldn't like it because of the art style? #$%
@#$ $#@ Part of the reason Prime and Super are so great is because of their art style. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to play as Samus is all. #$%
@#$ $#@ 58secs in. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is his wife #$%
@#$ $#@ I posted that before seeing her whole body. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's a 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is obvious lies and baiting #$%
@#$ $#@ Never trust hipsters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't ep 2 heavily hint that he was up to something. #$%
@#$ $#@ I seem to remember a shot of him acting suspicious in his car. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate people like you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuck up filth #$%
@#$ $#@ im guessing that dude kills the chick or something #$%
@#$ $#@ He did have that weird phone call in E1 or 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe with Daddy Prescott? #$%
@#$ $#@ Max is definitely going to jump back in time and butterfly effect the fuck out of everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ GREAT SCOT! #$%
@#$ $#@ GORDON FREEMAN #$%
@#$ $#@ The teacher rapes Chloe while Max watches. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was speaking inaudibly with Principal Wells before driving off into the sunset. #$%
@#$ $#@ I took it as a red herring. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're all 18. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's legal in most places. #$%
@#$ $#@ While masturbating herself #$%
@#$ $#@ yurop pls #$%
@#$ $#@ the only way a tumblr tier SJW faggot could ever play the victim card for the rest of their lives, they invent rape so they can act as if their entire existence is justified , its the entire world against them, and rape just solidifies it #$%
@#$ $#@ any youtube vids that support this? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's fuckin spooky #$%
@#$ $#@ Warren is going to fuck him up so bad #$%
@#$ $#@ I never knew Google search was advanced enough to recognize that type of query, I thought at most it acted like a calculator. #$%
@#$ $#@ Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't life is strange feminist shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Last episode is an action game where you play as Warren going ape on everyone #$%
@#$ $#@ Why don't you play it or watch a playthrough of it you dumb tripshit? #$%
@#$ $#@ I let Warren the cuck Hulk Out on Nathan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Here's hoping he comes to the rescue again. #$%
@#$ $#@ most of the main dudes are shitty, but most of the main girls are also shitty. #$%
@#$ $#@ i think he improved them #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause I'm not going to waste my time on something that gives me a feminist propaganda vibe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm all for hearing how its not like that, but from what I've seen in this thread, its further proving my suspicions. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have been wrong in the past though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried to find a video, but don't have one. #$%
@#$ $#@ An anon posted an image a few days ago showing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just made a meme face out of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're already wasting your time bitching about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't see the difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope at least you're acting like a retard on purpose. #$%
@#$ $#@ TRIPS OF TRUTH! #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesn't the shack say "Rachel Amber is here" when you go back? #$%
@#$ $#@ Common sense burn. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you're already making posts like this there is literally no chance in hell anyone can convince you otherwise #$%
@#$ $#@ great woman logic #$%
@#$ $#@ It says "you're going to die" or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chloe was yelling at me to hurry up so I didn't have a proper look. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, so it's not feminist shit, its just, shit...? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, that too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, don't you feel silly now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, only feminists mention or care about rape. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have never bothered to pick this game up so can someone fill me in on what happened? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also is the game worth getting? #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone playing through the episode in /lis/ had the jacket not spawn for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ she was missing for a while but theres no indication of when she actually died #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh my gooodddd #$%
@#$ $#@ glitch or was it something to do with choices? #$%
@#$ $#@ okay, I get donating a dollar or two but why the fuck would anyone donate $100 to a streamer? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then where is Nathan? #$%
@#$ $#@ Who knows? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm the 55% #$%
@#$ $#@ So main villain was straight white man ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Come on, i know they are many white knights and shills who regularly defend this shit, but don´t you think they are making it too easy to call this SJW The game ? #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesn't make any sense, forced foreshadowing is the fucking worst. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brote's one of the few streamers I see that legitimately starts freaking out when anyone sends him anything over like $10, and he realizes how fucking dumb it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ More like they're working together #$%
@#$ $#@ Main villain is a cool hipster SJW, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, because neither his straightness or his maleness or his whiteness are mentioned in any way as the cause of him being a villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nathan is bonkers, and is working with Jefferson. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nathan's the obvious culprit, so if he gets caught, he'll immediately spill it and then Jefferson would get fucked harder than he fucked those other girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ How come David Madsen turned out to be a good guy then? #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw some tumblr girls called "geek remix" go nuts for this tumblr game and they called it when ep 2 was out or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ The story is mildly interesting still watching streams instead of buying the game, fuck that, but the dialogue is the worst shit I've seen in years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Daily reminder that anyone who makes these threads, participates in them positively, or purchases this game support the feminist takeover of the video game industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did Jeffy kill Rachel presumably but not Chloe or Kate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything better get answered in the last episode goddamn #$%
@#$ $#@ What was the point in going to back to the past? #$%
@#$ $#@ he didn't know chloe and max were trailing him until the party where they said they were looking for nathan #$%
@#$ $#@ to play some shitty games that suck ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh, you were talking about the first 5-10 minutes of it and not the other 90% that mattered? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Tornado represents Warren going ape and becoming a force of nature to all the shit preppy kids at Blackwell! #$%
@#$ $#@ Max wanted to prevent chloe from having a bad life #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think Jeffy really had to do anything with Kate. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm getting confused. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mainly because back in Episode 2 or 3, remember Kate was directly talking to Jefferson before she anhero'd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would Kate of all people talk to, confront or even be in sight of Rapey Jeffy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you're a SJW faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to be king faggot you should buy the game like some other people on here #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy Shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a video of this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't got around to playing episode 4 yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I watched it online though. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh jeeze rick ohhh he just rapes her? #$%
@#$ $#@ i don't know that's pretty bad rick ohhhhh #$%
@#$ $#@ Ahahaha Y U see though me ? #$%
@#$ $#@ enin xD #$%
@#$ $#@ Huh, yeah, that makes sense #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably mostly to show that when you alter things too much, shit goes south, just like in Butterfly Effect. #$%
@#$ $#@ It felt a like it was just slapped on. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like there should have been more adventuring in Alternate Blackwell #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe it #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up, Chloe, you're the reason your dad is dead! #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought maybe any time another Max comes into her time line or something and takes her place she dreams/imagines it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably not right though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kind of like she's pushed into this tornado dream meanwhile the other Max does her shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ There should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ In a gameplay video. #$%
@#$ $#@ What if all prescotts are rapists and nathans dad wants him to continue the legacy, but all he wants to do is take photos, so they hire jefferson to help nathan continue the legacy? #$%
@#$ $#@ why are nigger memes ironically really funny #$%
@#$ $#@ Tumblr will actually think you believe this #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not sure Nathan is innocent; obviously he has a lot of complicity in Mark's big scheme. #$%
@#$ $#@ His jacket is in the bunker, he had the code for the bunker written down on that piece of paper with all the numbers on it, he's more than willing to at least drug and deliver victims like Kate to Mark. #$%
@#$ $#@ But he's not the orchestrator, and I'm not so sure he's even a rapist. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's just really fucked in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get it because he has glasses which means he can't normally see very well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I do agree that there is a protocol for such things. #$%
@#$ $#@ But for fucks sake, if you don't immediately recognize that west coast hipster douche male feminist wanna-be mug instantly then you haven't been on /v/ in 2015. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a thread up nearly 24 hours a day with his picture in it several times. #$%
@#$ $#@ She didn't remember what happened #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, I hope that game's good #$%
@#$ $#@ Kate said that there was a "soft voice," which she mistook for a doctor before feeling a needle in her neck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, her red binder is in the dark room. #$%
@#$ $#@ So Jefferson was most likely involved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Goddamnit shut up, Chloe, Rachel's dead because you're so clingy #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, I wish I thought of that first #$%
@#$ $#@ /pol/ pls #$%
@#$ $#@ I only played episode 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did the teacher rape Max? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why don´t she time-teleport away ? #$%
@#$ $#@ She's drugged by Jefferson, which hampers her powers. #$%
@#$ $#@ He stuck her before she did it and it impaired her abilities, which makes enough sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't even get how the time travel powers work sometimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ She seems to be able to hold onto things even when she goes back and also remains physically the same, so if she gets stuck with something wouldn't the drug still be in her anyways? #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck does it make sense ? #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck would someone know which drug to choose to reduce time travel powers ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the best thing about him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people don't like him? #$%
@#$ $#@ He's white and straight, and isn't even a killer, he doesn't kill human beings. #$%
@#$ $#@ He kills tumblr and SJWs. #$%
@#$ $#@ He does it for us. #$%
@#$ $#@ This man is doing it so we don't have to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you, Mr Jefferson. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's BTTF nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that Warren went alpha and beat up the big bully, he's going to be a professional author and Nathan will be his bitch slave for life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any game with a female protag is gonna be seen as a feminist game in /v/'s eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ it really doesn't have anything to do with feminism. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I used to think you weren't a total shitposter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Proved me wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can i play as him then ? #$%
@#$ $#@ No offense, but how? #$%
@#$ $#@ In a game that focuses on cliches and twists, the whole "hip young teacher" was an obvious suspect, along with creepy janitor and the principal #$%
@#$ $#@ She's in the split. #$%
@#$ $#@ In DLC, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's got something similar to AC's eagle vision, lets him differentiate between tumblr and human beings he is colorblind so he can't tell by looking at their hair colors. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't see Jack shit in the dark. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll have to find a video later. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds great, do i have to register at tumblr so i can preorder ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Smh at this bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ He had super powers and he killed a bunch of girls including my best friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, "feminazi" is thrown around in a way that feels shoehorned and completely nonsensical multiple times in the game, almost like it's in response to certain events that happened in the past year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nathan is an allegory for toxic masculinity. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how there were skaterboys skating where she jumped. #$%
@#$ $#@ Season 2 when? #$%
@#$ $#@ They have better sales when they pander to "muh daughteru" faggots with twd. #$%
@#$ $#@ He says hes the killer in first fucking episode, you just didn't pay attention. #$%
@#$ $#@ It took you off guard, but a lot of people were expecting him to.be the mastermind since episode 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ the only reason people guessed he was the killer was because the game desperately tried to make him a non suspect. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's the same type of mislead that many recent movies and books are using, so it's easy to see through it, but that's not really a good way to tell a murder mystery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Life is Strange is far, far better than any of TellTale's recent games. #$%
@#$ $#@ all circumstantial #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems more like a really heavy handed anti-bullying theme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like those shitty Lifetime channel movies. #$%
@#$ $#@ She got shot right in her fucking head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Based fuckin Jefferson, not only he's perfect in every way, he also has the eye of a hawk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Daily reminder that not buying games based purely on weather or not they pander to your political views and not on weather they're actually a fun fucking game makes you just as bad as the boogeyman you're 'fighting' against #$%
@#$ $#@ it's 'whether', anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does she steal another one or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ I only found 2 guns in the game, one from shooting Frank and one from brutalizing Nathan, both avoidable. #$%
@#$ $#@ she has a gun in episode 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you lose it to Frank in episode 2, she just takes it back from him when they fight in episode 4, or he gives it back to her. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you keep the gun in episode 2 and tell her to get rid of the gun before talking to Frank, she still picks it back up after you're done talking to him. #$%
@#$ $#@ its just cringy #$%
@#$ $#@ the only way to warn her and have her believe you is if you didn't take her picture in episode 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought she got shot in the shoulder too because that's where the blood came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chloe had blood on her forehead but it didn't really look like a bullet hole, unless Jefferson is a pussy who was only packing a .22 or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ noticed the replies/poster ratio for these threads tend to be kind of telling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you talking about exactly? #$%
@#$ $#@ she needs to be killed by a plane so that everything is okay #$%
@#$ $#@ Me thinks thou dost protest too much #$%
@#$ $#@ why wouldnt you rape a drugged out 18 year old thats tied up in your basement? #$%
@#$ $#@ calm down mor *burps* morty, it's just a little pena *burps* penetration #$%
@#$ $#@ Congrats on missing the point entirely. #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking hella kek #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is killing her even a choice if Max is going to rewind ten seconds later either way? #$%
@#$ $#@ The choice is irrelevant #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek fucking retard #$%
@#$ $#@ A girl with a confused sexuality is magic. #$%
@#$ $#@ She also browses Tumblr on the reg and her friend becomes braindead. #$%
@#$ $#@ link does not work anon #$%
@#$ $#@ she was a whore #$%
@#$ $#@ jacket didnt spawn m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ God, I fucking hate David when he was bullying my waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game straight-up tells you it's him at the start of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ and "now that i have a rare hipster i can summon the tornado god" is any better? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd respect the reveal more if that were the case #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit I thought he was so gay in the first episode, but he really went ape here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really like the game but it feels pretty niche. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's really cool to see some of your choices relativley matter and the time power aspect is cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think even if the writing is kinda weird it's a bit charming. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it a higher form of art? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's debatable. #$%
@#$ $#@ But it is very entertaining to play and I've enjoyed my time with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The twists are pretty cool too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good god this man is literally a hero holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Max at least give him a kiss on the cheek Jesus Christ #$%
@#$ $#@ Does he still get kicked out if you were nice to him the entire playthrough? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you side with him he takes Joice out to the nicest restaurant in town and stays in the house, he's in the garage and you have a really cool conversation with him which makes him a much more sympathetic character and makes Max admit he's actually a good guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ At the beginning he literally tells the class, but everyone is just too niggerish to notice #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the VA for Chloe really like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any source info about that ? #$%
@#$ $#@ CRACK EM #$%
@#$ $#@ Hot Fuzz is too good to be refrenced by this #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah im sure he does #$%
@#$ $#@ he's right why are you donating money to nobodies but he's not going to refund it back to you so whats the point, to hear 3 seconds of acknowledgment then forgotten again. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not just him the majority of streamers do it #$%
@#$ $#@ HOLY SHIT #$%
@#$ $#@ not so fast #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a fucking plot, the exact same scenario for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ it hasn't been long since they updated the banlist, also Konami decided they gonna release it whenever they feel like it instead of every 6 months #$%
@#$ $#@ Once per turn in your Main Phase, equip it to Aitsu or move it back to field in ATK, Monster equipped by this card increase 3000 of ATK/DEF, also pierce damage #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot card #$%
@#$ $#@ Full power TeleDAD or Yata-lock could wreck anything that exists currently #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, if you can read well Chel becomes a fucking joke, just as well it's good to use the Combo breaker loadout against her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not much, it's a technical alpha. #$%
@#$ $#@ 6 characters and very few alt moves. #$%
@#$ $#@ post ya steam my nig #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you hook me up? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's no steam version, it's just how anons are trying to get codes privately. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yo, here's some OC from the drawthread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't consider it an entry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, at least you're honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ weird, i didn't even know there were codes. #$%
@#$ $#@ it just told me to log into my account. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll get an e-mail with some codes eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure he meant that he can't set it to do an uppercut or fireball or whatever so he can test punishes and such #$%
@#$ $#@ And magic series is A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Can vouch for this entire list #$%
@#$ $#@ But why is not being confronted with your mistakes immediately good? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not good, but it keeps players from losing motivation #$%
@#$ $#@ i agree #$%
@#$ $#@ You should have no trouble with Vlad. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's literally shit and can't do anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of his stuff is predictable as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you use Kinetic Deflect? #$%
@#$ $#@ Press two special buttons simultaneously while being bodied. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll have a code please. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been itching to tr this after being burned out on USFIV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like a pussy who gets hit in the first place #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm getting more of a Gurren Lagann vibe from Edge, though that may just be the green flames and red-on-white color scheme. #$%
@#$ $#@ the Kinetic Advance reduces cooldowns of most moves, not sure about complete reset though #$%
@#$ $#@ Post a smug semen demon and I can hook you up. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this smug enough #$%
@#$ $#@ you gonna post steam id or you wanna get scalped for a code? #$%
@#$ $#@ or this guy, just fight each other for this guy's code #$%
@#$ $#@ Crow and Edge #$%
@#$ $#@ The korean one #$%
@#$ $#@ Definitely Crow. #$%
@#$ $#@ Edge if you want actual 中国 edges, Crow if you want Black flames Korean. #$%
@#$ $#@ What does the Kinetic thing do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you save this? #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasn't even interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had the projectile super won it actually might have been surprising, but anyone who has played a fighter would intuitively expect Dauntless' punch super to beat it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Allows you too move cancel or too combo breaker #$%
@#$ $#@ basically its FADC except you only need to dash/jump to cancel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go away gook. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see, thanks for the heads up bubs. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was destiny. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's okay it's legal now #$%
@#$ $#@ You should play Vlad instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's piloted by a dog just like everyone in your country. #$%

@#$ $#@ Who is this flower vendor? #$%
@#$ $#@ Splash woman, a robot master built by dr Light to save people in the ocean that was due to be decommissioned and scrapped because of her expiration date until Wily offered to repair her but all he did was reprogram her to not go quietly into that good night, #$%
@#$ $#@ Splashwoman from MM9. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her and that ghost girl were faps of the week from 2008. #$%
@#$ $#@ PC port when? #$%
@#$ $#@ Works in Dolphin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta obey the law. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to snuggle her tail #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder, did the original Light units expired? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Megaman and Roll simply let their brothers get thrown into the scrap heap. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Megaman and Roll have expiration dates? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know where you've been, but it's already started. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck does any robot have an expiration date? #$%
@#$ $#@ not really. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're the first fight-able woman to appear in the original Megaman games #$%
@#$ $#@ She has a pretty ugly design to be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Splash-Man or whatever actually looked much better. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon, free beer cans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Archie isn't canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant stuff like the Gameboy games #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Wily own the Cossack bots now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or did he just steal them again in those? #$%
@#$ $#@ They probably all ended up in the robot museum. #$%
@#$ $#@ The MM9bots didn't have that luxury. #$%
@#$ $#@ Inafune is the inky one to explicitly veto the Cataclysm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that he's been discredited, is that explanation for the Classic-&gt; X transition viable? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure he went out in a blaze of glory with Proto Man. #$%
@#$ $#@ I refuse to believe otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only as DLC, which is even more questionable in regards to canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but aren't those DLC stages which aren't really connected to the main game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ghost Girl from Curse of the Werehog, a promotional video for Sonic Unleashed. #$%
@#$ $#@ This girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks hideous why would anyone touch their dick for her? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's been seven years so I'm guessing people were young and horny. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's really annoying that Capcom and Archie are discontinuing the partnership, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ What made Archie lose so much money that they can't afford to reup the contract? #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly I'm a little glad the comic isn't going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's selfish, I know, but seeing how things went for Protoman and pretty much the entire Sonic crew makes me shudder to imagine what Ian would do to my waifu and favorite RMs. #$%
@#$ $#@ And going by Gameboy games he refused to just let them die forever and kept them with purpose in their lives #$%
@#$ $#@ Protoman is still in the middle of his character arc. #$%
@#$ $#@ So are many of the RMs. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's way worse that they end on a down note than working through their problems. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather be killed with my dignity intact than necro'd only to be given "another purpose". #$%
@#$ $#@ In public, you could just treat her as a personal servant. #$%
@#$ $#@ People would look at you strange for having an immobile memaid as an actual maid, but they wouldn't attack her so long as she appeared to be under the control of a human. #$%
@#$ $#@ I genuinely don't understand this mindset. #$%
@#$ $#@ Programmers in real life are constantly trying to make AI more human. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are people so opposed to humanlike AI in their media? #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you prefer robots that look like this then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because then all you have is a speshul snowflake human. #$%
@#$ $#@ What makes AI wonderful is that theoretically they can surpass us and become the only other sentient self-aware race we know, and more advanced at that. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is exciting. #$%
@#$ $#@ A machine who is a human is not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wily is still worse, stealing other's kids and reviving his own to fight for him over and over. #$%
@#$ $#@ A biological creature is just a machine made from carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ instead of electricity. #$%
@#$ $#@ If robots with human level intelligence are even possible, "humans in suits" are not at all far-fetched. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Light and Cossack was so much better why didn't they salvage their creations? #$%
@#$ $#@ We don't really know what happens to the Cossack kids after 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ As for Light, I've got nothing to defend him in this case, he's just as much of a bastard I suppose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you forgotten me already, /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kindly fuck off #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't mean that as a derogatory towards organic life, I mean that as a boon towards whatever inorganic life humans end up creating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally worst gem in all senses #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, yes and no. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was a conflict, sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the Reloids were basically humans by any other name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Upload a human brain, give it an artificial body, and you get the exact same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series never really did anything to show how they are different. #$%
@#$ $#@ shes best gem you nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as she still has those hips, I don't care if she's a sexy woman or a sexy robot. #$%
@#$ $#@ what about Iris? #$%
@#$ $#@ Centaur woman? #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone say robots? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cold, hard and shiny feels better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Putting the 'butts' in 'robutts'. #$%
@#$ $#@ fat fish tits best #$%
@#$ $#@ WILY DID NOTHING BAD #$%
@#$ $#@ Fupoo has the best titty splash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because X is the true sex appeal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is he so obsessed with Splash Woman? #$%
@#$ $#@ shes the best #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong girl, you fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, out of the gba and up games the only female I wanted to stick my dick into was Roll.exe #$%
@#$ $#@ She's great #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking weaver. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something about this dude pisses me off. #$%
@#$ $#@ He always pretends he's so humble and shit when he has an entire fucking imageboard dedicated to him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Loved nearly everyone in that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marriage =/= dating spehss pope. #$%
@#$ $#@ So are Roll and SplashwoMan literally the only female robot masters? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd make either live,just with a different story from the sidelines. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ashe is a treasure hunter who travels with grey as model A. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aile is Megaman ZX with Vent helping out bisiness delivery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Serpent was corrupt and was not inherently evil,only possesed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prometheus and Pandora are beneath the ocean,but can still survive with a twist of fate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus fuck I can't into english #$%
@#$ $#@ It's entirely possible that Ashe just wasn't around. #$%
@#$ $#@ After all, she didn't necessarily need to be there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grey is a bit harder to say that, since as you said, he's probably had a battle there and there wasn't anywhere for him to be but the tube he woke up in. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, because I'm not 5 years old. #$%
@#$ $#@ mega Man is about GAMEPLAY. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man killed them in the first game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Than it'll be better then what I'm expecting #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, US. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just never ever proofread my posts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Different fetishes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people like the external part being inhuman, some people like the internal part being inhuman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, what do you expect? #$%
@#$ $#@ The more mechanical a robogirl is, the better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonic Boom cartoon is alright with moments of pure gold. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because Archie is making both Sonic/Mega Man comics does not mean that the same people will be making the Mega Man cartoon as the Sonic Boom cartoon people. #$%
@#$ $#@ The sonic boom cartoon is pretty much fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as it has metal external texture, I like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Things like glass lenses instead of humanlike eye structure, joints working without warping the metal, etc is optional but cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Mega Man has blue arms already #$%
@#$ $#@ That looks something straight out of a manga! #$%
@#$ $#@ What are the robo tits for? #$%
@#$ $#@ It had better be cheesy. #$%
@#$ $#@ seeing in the dark #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't be him, the planet is inhospitable to humans at that point, #$%
@#$ $#@ Is X smelling Ciel's eye? #$%
@#$ $#@ What a creep #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the art style is crap. #$%
@#$ $#@ Basic robotic enhancements? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well it was done by a hentai artist. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to do things to that Roll. #$%
@#$ $#@ If this was supposed to give me an erection, they succeeded. #$%
@#$ $#@ With women like this in his life, is it any wonder Zero was never one for romance? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been staring at this picture for 15 minutes trying to figure out how the fuck that background works #$%
@#$ $#@ The only way that Zero is a boy is because of his voice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Without it Zero would be a girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Robot Gender Roles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even once. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't really act like a girl though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's basically just the long hair and glass tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aile has neither long hair or tits and is a girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, Zero is basically their only option that wouldn't be incest. #$%
@#$ $#@ What about Axl? #$%
@#$ $#@ X clearly likes the kid, but he has the strongest bond with Zero over anyone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Axl is more like a little brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don`t miss this. #$%
@#$ $#@ 8 or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to attend the wedding of X and Zero! #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is X so small? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ruining /a/ shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Say no more! #$%
@#$ $#@ How mean... #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, Light must be a sadist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do they even have blood to begin with? #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't they say in the Mega Man &amp; Bass data that Slash Man was inspired off of Pluto? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's just oil. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've thought about a fire emblem fates version of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry man. #$%
@#$ $#@ But not even fans can give your OTP a happy ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never forget you, but please... #$%
@#$ $#@ If you would.. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mind letting your hair out for once if you may #$%
@#$ $#@ Archie OC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Original the character #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually no he's 100 percent obsessed with Snakeman #$%
@#$ $#@ I want neo /v/ to leave. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not the guy you replied to, but that still doesn't make it any less, you know, fucking horrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ You do realize that heroes aren't supposed to do that, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd quake her woman #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is exactly why their spaceship had a bigass planet zogging laserbeam attached to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't make an omelet without reinitializing a few carbons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to Tumblr please,we're talking video games girls and that might trigger you #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it, the Master's death shows earth is still inhospitable for human life, so what purpose does it serve to kill all carbons and then clone new humans to put in that toxic wasteland? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's implied that master died because something in elysium was keeping him alive, not because the earth is somewhat toxic. #$%
@#$ $#@ In fact the carbons might be actually derived from the human genome. #$%
@#$ $#@ but I don't trust megaman animu plot to get genetics corretly anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ Would probably also tease her about being an old unwanted spinster, given her expiration date and all. #$%
@#$ $#@ So a bullying older sister? #$%
@#$ $#@ A bullying smug older sister. #$%
@#$ $#@ More sensors #$%
@#$ $#@ I have not completed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ War would be a thing of the past, and so would loneliness. #$%
@#$ $#@ More sexual bee puns and less fish/water ones #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm afraid I like Hornet Man way too much to be okay with this #$%
@#$ $#@ Yet another cardinal sin to bring up at this fucker's death trial. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate "her" very existence #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like he has much competence. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some early japanese drawings are still better than him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe you anon, but not everyone is. #$%
@#$ $#@ My face is definitely my worst part. #$%
@#$ $#@ A body suit change won't affect much. #$%
@#$ $#@ But they still use masculine words for themselves #$%
@#$ $#@ Splash woman should have just been Splash then. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, all those conversations with the robot masters #$%
@#$ $#@ That Ciel turn me on, she is fucking yandere for Zero, look how she mind break raped leviathan just for saying "you will never understand zero". #$%
@#$ $#@ Powered Up #$%
@#$ $#@ You let the "sjw/anti-sjw" shit really get to you if you really hate Splash Woman just because such a reason like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't have minded this #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is she the only enemy robot master to not get a suffix to name? #$%
@#$ $#@ no, I hate pandering, it has nothing to do with SJW #$%
@#$ $#@ You start. #$%
@#$ $#@ More Honey Woman/Plant Man pics, for one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you amuse they are genderless? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's more like you making up shit just to get angry. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were designed to be as human as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why give them female and male mental quirks but make them look the same #$%
@#$ $#@ Like i said, gender quirks. #$%
@#$ $#@ How many of the females in your family are say, in the military #$%
@#$ $#@ again, not the issue, it's the same issue as words like "firewoman" and whatnot, it's pointless, the -man suffix is simply to denote that your job or something about you relates to that, there would be no issue in calling "her" spalsh man #$%
@#$ $#@ Her chassis was built that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ What manga was that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ pic on the right was one hell of a doujin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I'm thinking about futa Honey Woman trying to pollinate Plant Man #$%
@#$ $#@ Futas for faggots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Real men go for gender swaps #$%
@#$ $#@ So Hornet Man trying to fuck Plant Man? #$%
@#$ $#@ You know it nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's a bridge the robot's resting her hand on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes a bit more sense once you figure that out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Futa honey woman impregnating plant woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only meant to stay a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ So you mean Hornet Man x Splash Man? #$%
@#$ $#@ Futa Honey Woman jamming her stinger directly into Splash Woman's ovaries through her hole and fertilizing her eggs before she lays them #$%
@#$ $#@ So what about the other mirrion girl robot masters #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of porn are we talking about here? #$%
@#$ $#@ scrapped and turned into beer cans like the rest #$%
@#$ $#@ I think her name is Flower Woman or something since Honey=/=Hornet and Ocean=/=Splash #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a good alternative. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, your right. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a geo hair for sdt, despite it being a smaller spinoff but there's literally only zero otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems disporportionate #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like Ocean Man has too many fins, and I love Hornet Man's visor. #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sayashit is literally worst meguca #$%
@#$ $#@ How about a game where Roll is the default player character and the bosses consist of Honey Woman, Quake Woman, girl versions of Plant Man, Shade Man, Pharaoh Man, Metal Man, Guts Man, and token guy Ocean Man? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been meaning to do a blowjob with her but I just haven't made time. #$%
@#$ $#@ google it #$%
@#$ $#@ How can you be sure splash woman isn't man pretending to be a woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could be gay and not even know it man. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll start transferring data and find out it's that latest hardware but "she's" and older model. #$%
@#$ $#@ What then #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks doc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Robots can't love #$%
@#$ $#@ SpongeBob pls. #$%
@#$ $#@ I take offence to that. #$%
@#$ $#@ what the fuck is wrong with her face? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, monster girls are fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do cute robot girls have to do with feminism? #$%
@#$ $#@ You fucking bet I would if the toaster is hot #$%
@#$ $#@ That bastard #$%
@#$ $#@ What no it was robots. #$%
@#$ $#@ The robot murdered a dude, and they "shut him down" #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe the calendar is Capcom Girls themed, so that's the only Mega Man page. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other pages have other Capcom ladies. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a good calendar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah shit posted my iwata cosplay accidently #$%
@#$ $#@ Too soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Going by this, I guess more sensors. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is my fetish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bonus points if their pulling the wires out like intestines in a prison shanking #$%
@#$ $#@ who knows #$%
@#$ $#@ If it helps any, this is official art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same thing as robo fat. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'd kiss Rock on the cheek if you had the chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure the doctors found ways to make lifelike not-skin that isn't latex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because of allergic reactio-oh my god imagine finding out your allergic to materials inside a flashlight or dildo after the fact #$%
@#$ $#@ How did this work again? #$%
@#$ $#@ we getting pretty spooky tonight #$%
@#$ $#@ Robots, humans; we all hold a spoopy skellington captive inside us. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is our lives that keep these demons at bay, #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering that you can build every part of a reploid, and transfer memories to others, you could part by part replace the entire reploid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it still the same reploid? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, you'd end up with a complete set of spare parts...which you could put together. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is that reploid then? #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off, queers. #$%
@#$ $#@ ghost girl is cute and sexy as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you replace the working parts, you get a different machine. #$%
@#$ $#@ My sexbot #$%
@#$ $#@ That's why you and your robot waifu need to run system tests on a weekly basis. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're not even entirely sure if humans are the same person each time waking from sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm both disgusted and enamoured by this art style. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't want to play god though, I just want peace and quiet with a robot girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where's her nose? #$%
@#$ $#@ It kept falling off whenever she punted babies. #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't get a Vita, you'll only be disappointed. #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight nepper #$%

@#$ $#@ why do you want a vita? #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight, nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ Get the PSTV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sleep tight nepper #$%
@#$ $#@ And what games can't the PSTV play? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I heard it has some compatibility issues. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can play pretty much everything worth playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ You bought the smallest, cheapest, and weakest version, and are basing your entire opinion of the system on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, what are some good games? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll try whatever, as long as it's not in Panty Quest territory. #$%
@#$ $#@ inboxer fuck u the nes version of tetris sucks the game boy one is the best #$%
@#$ $#@ one game. #$%
@#$ $#@ post your id ya fuckin imbecile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit forgot the picture #$%
@#$ $#@ back in time my family can afford only nes #$%
@#$ $#@ His 10 fake ass Sonichu Amiibo sold out in 2 hours at $410 EACH. #$%
@#$ $#@ He made $410 on this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's is actually proving demand for his shitty knock-off. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Sonichu gets a cameo in an official Sonic game and he makes money on that shit I will kill myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regardless, he is making money on this shit and gets exposure and it's all our fault. #$%
@#$ $#@ The more fucked up thing is it's probably parents buying them for their kids because their kids want Amiibos and they actually think it has something to do with Sonic or Pokemon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't even know what to think right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least he's actually doing something to make some money, besides getting his welfare check. #$%
@#$ $#@ The people that keep up with every little CWC detail are more autistic than he is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes that's right. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't want you to guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want you to have good taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well aren't you a fat whiny cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ the original post is from d2g and if you aren't from there get the fuck out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you even speak english? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not commenting on any choices. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you win I will add you and announce the win. #$%
@#$ $#@ How would you make a Code Geass game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is code geass the only good anime with mechs #$%
@#$ $#@ /m/ would like a word with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ code geass was a good anime m8 it was fun to watch Characters were likable and had a really good ending 8/10 anime #$%
@#$ $#@ an anime that is fun to watch is a good anime in general #$%
@#$ $#@ Only sonycucks could think such a terrible animoo was any good #$%
@#$ $#@ Im actually a Nintendo guy #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the best "Code Geass" game would be an strategy game, like an RTS or 4X, which draws heavily from Geass's characters and plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ fun media is good media you fucking retard #$%
@#$ $#@ You're some amnesiac donut steel dropped into the story around the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a Geass route with focus on CC, Black Knights routes for Kallen, Lelouch, and Diethard. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's also ALL HAIL BRITTANIA #$%
@#$ $#@ With misinterpreted chess rules and magical mary seus warfare without an ounce of actual strategy #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is it a train wreck? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mustard race. #$%
@#$ $#@ But S2 had Bunny Kallen, that has to count for something. #$%
@#$ $#@ At a certain point towards the end of season 1, and increasingly in season 2, the writer just said fuck it and started making it as ridiculous as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it hits maximum absurdity around the time everyone is Zero #$%
@#$ $#@ absurdity =/= trainwreck #$%
@#$ $#@ This is what the master race watches. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't call that a train wreck if it's still a fun ride. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Inafune shit is a train wreck. #$%
@#$ $#@ No fucking shit they gave up, they had an almost complete hard reset and had to kind of catch new viewers up and the fact that they lost 4 episodes to catch everyone up didn't help, that and they had to waste episodes reintroducing Lelouch's reason for even being Zero and then pushing him away so the ham could continue to be chewed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, they wrote themselves into a corner by dragging things out between the revival of Zero and the end-game that followed his exile from the Black Knights. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a weak looking ass mech that Kallen is riding. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like shit, I have fatter legs than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Way to ruin the design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget he sold out the entire UN just for Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ JUST for a free Japan HE gets to control. #$%
@#$ $#@ NEVER FORGET. #$%
@#$ $#@ AROUND OUGIS NEVER RELAX. #$%
@#$ $#@ both are good anime #$%
@#$ $#@ sekai sae mo #$%
@#$ $#@ I said RTS or 4X, not... #$%
@#$ $#@ whatever that is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that a terrible Advance Wars ripoff or a poor excuse for an SRPG? #$%
@#$ $#@ There is nowhere enough material for whatever the hell it is you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ Suzaku is a slow shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Name your favorite color /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ no one is comparing gundam to code gayass... #$%
@#$ $#@ I marothonned that series for two days straight and that was the point where I had to start drinking profusely. #$%
@#$ $#@ I seriously want to meet the person who wrote that whole sequence in, holy shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Just one little fuck up causes so much bullshit holy fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Lelouch #$%
@#$ $#@ Hence why it should be a fingerquote "Code Geass" game instead of a Code Geass adaptation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh, you don't get to pick wario. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's more often than not fun to play as not to mention theres a satisfaction beating another person as Wario you can get nowhere else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Double Dash? #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably Sakamoto not understanding Wario when making Warioware #$%
@#$ $#@ there is none since waluigi exists #$%
@#$ $#@ Since when did peach fart in that game? #$%
@#$ $#@ For best results get into close range and in the ideal situation wait til he flashes with fartgas energy and let er rip in close range either beside or below them. #$%
@#$ $#@ kill yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been using Wario in every Smash game I can fan made or not, he's fun as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ mah nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your You #$%
@#$ $#@ The glory of ass carried a destructive force, you faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing to do with literal shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stay Mad #$%
@#$ $#@ Me too #$%
@#$ $#@ IM GONNA KILL PRAXIS #$%
@#$ $#@ I normally don't believe these post. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I believe you, that's awesome! #$%
@#$ $#@ Please tell me that's not official. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be honest the driving missions were godawful and the hub world was tedious to navigate. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was alright, I wouldn't say I out right hated it but it was certainly different compared to PCL. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was fun, especially the last area. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just can't fucking stand that racing shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather they tried something different that make another generic colorful collectathon. #$%
@#$ $#@ They made fun games in the PS1 and PS2 days. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm actually glad they scrapped that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ what was the purpose of the web? #$%
@#$ $#@ why did he punch it just to open it from the bottom? #$%
@#$ $#@ is that the sky on the other side or it's just a wall? #$%
@#$ $#@ this shit hurts my brain #$%
@#$ $#@ I should have clarified ps3 onwards #$%
@#$ $#@ Me on the left. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not gaming but I like this alice #$%
@#$ $#@ Woah, takes me back. #$%
@#$ $#@ ALICE IS CUTE!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ I like it when my Alice is a giant robot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Second best because I used to fap to this all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Margatroid is a welcome Alice #$%
@#$ $#@ I came here to post this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is teddy white? #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually Alice is Lewis Caroll's waifu and he'll fight you over her. #$%
@#$ $#@ please post it all #$%
@#$ $#@ I prefer Madness Returns, though I enjoy the original as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you say so #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta go with this, snek Alice is best Alice #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is your Alice branded like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ No clue, I'm on my phone and didn't have any pictures of Alice so I just grabbed something #$%
@#$ $#@ my man #$%
@#$ $#@ it's only gay if it's 3dpd, or irl #$%
@#$ $#@ What makes you say that? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can´t fucking claim best one at start. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am exactly like you, my desire to name my eventual daughter Alice are completely unrelated to Alice L. #$%
@#$ $#@ but since I also like Alice L., my gf automatically thinks that's the reason why i would want to name her so, and despite my explanations of how that is not the reason, she won't let go of her misjudgment, forbidding me to even mention the idea since she has already said no for said reasons. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's cute, but why does Alice need an anime style? #$%
@#$ $#@ Might just get that because it looks pretty. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm more interested in that Queen of Hearts. #$%
@#$ $#@ for me it's Alice and Elizabeth #$%
@#$ $#@ It was literally written for children. #$%
@#$ $#@ Love doesn't always mean "want to stick my dick in," anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems mods have good taste in threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ As she wandered over the mushroom she passed one of her shoes she kicked of earlier when she was getting comfortable, now it was the size of a house to her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alices touched the black leather wall in front of her and stroked over it, the shiny smooth surface appeared now rough and uneven. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Its uncanny that my feet where in this before" Alice looked down at her stocking clad feet and wiggled her toes. #$%
@#$ $#@ "I wonder what it would be like to have feet that can fit into those shoes." She immediatly got a laughing fit as she imagend herself with house sized feet. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was still giggleing when she got to the other edge of the mushroom. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Oh dear thats quite high. #$%
@#$ $#@ " alice thought as she looked doen the mushroom that was skyscrapersized to her. #$%
@#$ $#@ She broke off a big piece of mush oom and got away from the edge because the vertigo was beginning to creep her out. #$%
@#$ $#@ She sat down again with the mushroom piece and the hookah she is carring that thing around all the time, occasionally taking a puff, here is to hope the poor girl doesn´t develop a habit. #$%
@#$ $#@ She takes a bite out of it and to her delight This side DOES taste great. #$%
@#$ $#@ She manages too take another few bites as the all familliar feeling returned. #$%
@#$ $#@ big alice &gt;&gt;&gt; tiny alice #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Tiny Alice, there's more for her to interact with when little, like Talking fliwers and insects. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played OMNI vs ZAFT 2 on PS2 a lot so I supposes Id be able to get around Battle Destiny as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know much Japanese soI feel a bit weary of Gundam Breaker eventhough Ive heard its better #$%

@#$ $#@ I'm don't have any sad reactions saved on my computer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry too much about it - the game actually plays perfectly fine on keyboard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I probably never would have got to play Morrowind if it wasn't for Skyrim. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never bothered with RPGs much prior. #$%
@#$ $#@ People say it shit because they expected too much, they believe the hype and then get fucked when the game doesn't live up to that manufactured hype, then, they are let down, disappointed thus declaring the game to be shit. #$%

@#$ $#@ That's funny. #$%

@#$ $#@ I can't replay DQIV after I found out SE removed party chat from the localized version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mint Chocolate Chip is the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like Minecraft done right. #$%
@#$ $#@ i've never had a Blizzard, or DQ in general. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would assume there's an .iso inside #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks good, I'm getting it for sure #$%
@#$ $#@ but anon, they are creating a version that is vastly inferior. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which version of 11? #$%
@#$ $#@ some dragon quest VIII promo pictures were my first vidya fap. #$%
@#$ $#@ What's wrong with 7-zip? #$%
@#$ $#@ Given how hard they're nostalgia-fag pandering with 11-3DS Hell, given that there's a separate version of the console version of 11 to fucking begin with, I sincerely fucking doubt they will. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't know Australia had Dairy Queens. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder that nintendo fanboys always instigate console wars #$%
@#$ $#@ No, both are emulated just fine in your PS2 emulator #$%
@#$ $#@ Indeed, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most likely will be looking at Heroes numbers and they will localize those based on Heroes numbers. #$%
@#$ $#@ They said they saw the success of Hyrule Warriors as their reason they are using this as their gauge because of our love of action RPGs even after they were quoted in saying that we are a fan of normal turn base RPG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been trying to learn moon at the mean time and it's been not going smoothly at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they're not expecting HW's western sales, because I don't think this game can sell 700k in the west. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, but it doesn't feel good to play on a phone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention the party chat doesn't have the accents, so it clashes pretty badly with everything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most believe what Horii meant was that he feels they will come rather than they are. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not really musou, and for that reason I'm glad. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sick of Warriors reskins and I only tolerated Hyrule Warriors because I'm a massive fanboy of Zelda. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just some bullshit term SE is saying because they can get away with it, Musou is considered an off shoot of ARPG but if they call it what it is then its a confirmed flop, not like its going to sell anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Accents are still there, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ In the party chat? #$%
@#$ $#@ Which version? #$%
@#$ $#@ Using a guide? #$%
@#$ $#@ You guys are going to look so foolish when 7/8 3DS and 11 are confirmed for localization. #$%
@#$ $#@ On the phone, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been playing the Android version on the bus. #$%
@#$ $#@ It won't be too bad, unless you're like me and jumped the gun and couldn't make it to the designated grind spot. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Cave to Rhone couldn't touch me but I got killed in one Rhone encounter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be careful! #$%
@#$ $#@ PCSX2, you tard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget the phone version has horrible frame rate, crashes, and from what I've heard controls are fucked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but I've been idling on the check out page for that game for awhile now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the least weeb shit to come out of Japan ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ 7 is one of the worst just from a gameplay perspective. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the most grindy, the encounter rate feels higher and there's more back and forth than most other games. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also has some of the best storytelling in the series though, and the massive length makes you really invested in everything compared to the others. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll be good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Moonbrooke is worth the grinding to make up the extra levels, and make your Princes even stronger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally everything you mentioned is fixed in the 3DS version. #$%
@#$ $#@ The PS2 version doesn't have party chat? #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there good FemHero doujins? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm bored with Pilgrim and Soldier. #$%
@#$ $#@ No it does. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's hardly anything different outside of the third Bride. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the other stuff are so minor you would never noticed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not many, beats those shitty horse doujins DQ5 is covered with, even some of the devs call the people who write and likes those fucked in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't understand what's with the wait? #$%
@#$ $#@ it feels like they are using PS4 platform to judge the brand familiarity and demand. #$%
@#$ $#@ IT'S A DQ FOR FUCK SAKE! #$%
@#$ $#@ Viral Marketing is enough to market DQ! #$%
@#$ $#@ I would prefer 3ds but that's fine too, I have a hard time playing long RPGs on consoles anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if a NX version is going to happen the games will be out long before the NX is on the market. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are not the only one brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Idk about NX, but if they localized both 3ds and ps4 versions by the grace of God, I'd buy both since they are sisually so different and also both have a cool thing, with 3ds and it's classic mode and ps4s jumping exploration capabilities. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hero is the only one. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will learn all the spells and all the equipment is yours to use. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will hella stronk as you take on the world by yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then DIE, wench! #$%
@#$ $#@ *darkness takes over my mind and I launch a dark fireball at you* #$%
@#$ $#@ Famitsu scans already prove you wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ PS4 version is still traditional turn based. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's all the same server anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your characters aren't stored locally either, I don't know what the point of your post is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm impressed that the PS2 was a literal potato compared to the GameCube and Xbox, but it still had games like these that look heads and shoulders above anything on them. #$%
@#$ $#@ How does this happen, is this what 90% marketshare does? #$%
@#$ $#@ 'Tis the power of l'emulatus, laddie. #$%
@#$ $#@ DQ rocks, you're missing out #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually there are 3 ending in Dragon Quest 1. #$%
@#$ $#@ One where you don't rescue her, one where you did, and one where you take her on your journey to kill the Dragon Lord. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of SE's mmos have used the same servers across all platforms and continents. #$%
@#$ $#@ except maybe the 360 version of ffxi, but im pretty sure that one was on the same as the rest too. #$%
@#$ $#@ no the emulator can use the iso #$%
@#$ $#@ If they don't want us playing the damn games why don't just saying loud and clear? #$%
@#$ $#@ it will break alot of hearts but atleas we won't get our hopes up and then being dragged down like they're doing it now. #$%
@#$ $#@ They know why. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's to stop us from spamming their official accounts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your normal guy's on an ffxiv kick #$%
@#$ $#@ Those pigs wizard hats. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit that's adorable #$%
@#$ $#@ What are they called? #$%
@#$ $#@ he's the gamedev people want and deserve #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant VII but you get the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think you might mean 7. #$%
@#$ $#@ And it's just a whole bunch of adventures. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell you don't actually unlock the class system until 40 hours in. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're pretty fun and last a long ass time depending on how must you like dragon quest and leveling/creating different monsters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Each of the jokers titles has a sizable story to go through as you discover new lands and get through tough monsters while experimenting on your own. #$%
@#$ $#@ The first one was good, 2nd one made improvements over the 1st and is much faster, more monsters, Giant monsters which is the theme, and generally more things to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, forgot to add, definitely start with one. #$%
@#$ $#@ We didn't get the Pro version of number 2, but it's still alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ 1's pacing is much nicer. #$%
@#$ $#@ It does but its not as imporant as in other MMOs, hell the game can actually be played single player only. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, very. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sexy or bust #$%
@#$ $#@ He could be playing as a guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Poor life choice #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't say it was the best choice just a choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think, shouldn't be hard to get but even if you cant you don't need it to have fun with the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get that just saying 16 in some states is legal adult age. #$%
@#$ $#@ And to me max shota is 13 #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know the legal age here I just assumed its 18, I just like older woman and younger male #$%
@#$ $#@ How it works is if you multiplayer with someone with the DLC you get that DLC. #$%
@#$ $#@ So if you give the AR the stuff then multiplayer with it the real cart gets it. #$%
@#$ $#@ But please someone correct me if I'm wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ IV of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ VII &gt; V &gt; IV &gt; VIII &gt; VI #$%
@#$ $#@ That's because it was the first game that did everything right. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want the Dragon Quest experience, III is the game to go to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shota just mean prepubescent boys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like with lolis being young girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ action replay is just a cheat device though, you plug your game into it and you can hack your levels etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want to know if it can give me all the dlc content. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know its not required but if I miss out on content my ocd acts up and I pretty much drop the game #$%
@#$ $#@ I was going to buy one of those metal slime statues and put it on my Wii U or PS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best game thats why #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard back perk please #$%
@#$ $#@ The key does not break the locks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Working locks are important, no? #$%
@#$ $#@ Was ZombiU even any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ A friend of mine picked this up literally a couple days ago but I haven't gotten a chance to check it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a good game. #$%
@#$ $#@ African American survivors gonna shoot you from a distance to get your light saber. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who gives a shit about a password when a lightsaber can cut through anything? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're not a jedi, you just have the sword. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's an above average launch title that had a pretty interesting gimmick with the gamepad. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Losing that functionality in the ports takes away pretty much the only aspect that made it different from every other zombie survival game on the market. #$%
@#$ $#@ Blacks would. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zombie Detector. #$%
@#$ $#@ The name of the game is survival and knowing where and how many zeds are in any given area is a huge boon. #$%
@#$ $#@ The key #$%
@#$ $#@ It does though, almost every launch is complete ass #$%
@#$ $#@ *punches you in the face* #$%
@#$ $#@ Not necessarily. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can have water, canned food, ammo, and tools on your back + plus you can move at full speed, and you can hike without getting fatigued from the weight. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously you motherfuckers need to watch Star Wars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lightsaber will chop your well rested ass in half. #$%
@#$ $#@ what if the room is made out of Captain America shields :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ If having the lightsabre automatically makes you a jedi having the gun automatically makes me John Woo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it worth noting that using a lightsaber is hard because of the rapidly rotating gyroscope inside of it? #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess you wont be dueling zombies but if you slip up you do slice off a limb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only a moron wouldn't take that key. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitch please! #$%
@#$ $#@ The light saber is essentially an upgraded katana aka the best weapon ever conceived. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a katana can deflect bullets just imagine what a lightsaber can do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you can use your lightsaber to melt them into a zombie-proof suit #$%
@#$ $#@ God damnit Anon #$%
@#$ $#@ it doesn't turn you into a jedi and jedis can't block bulelts anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ Have fun getting cabin fever #$%
@#$ $#@ The drawback is that you don't have a fucking lightsaber #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga, 1 loaf and 500ml isn't much #$%
@#$ $#@ As much as the bag can FIT. #$%
@#$ $#@ It does not remove the volume and isn't a bottomless bag. #$%
@#$ $#@ enjoy being shot when they don't know who you are #$%
@#$ $#@ What about the soldiers on said base? #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt they're gonna let anyone in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then what the fuck do you need the key for? #$%
@#$ $#@ Important to note is that it isn't just zombies that can consider you food. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cannibal patrol is definitely a thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why do you need the key? #$%
@#$ $#@ Complete ignorance of military protocol ITT. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know... #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think I've ever seen anyone in a zombie movie complain about how their current pool of supplies is lasting so long. #$%
@#$ $#@ cabin fevers bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain please. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes probably a clerk. #$%
@#$ $#@ nigga you wouldn't even be able to start a jet let alone crash one. #$%
@#$ $#@ And they're just gonna let you take all this because?....... #$%
@#$ $#@ you can feel hunger you dumbass #$%
@#$ $#@ Space is still limited it just doesnt weigh anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the stupidest upgrade ever #$%
@#$ $#@ If the apocalypse persists after 10 years you might as well kill youself. #$%
@#$ $#@ And what are you going to do after you steal shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just leave? #$%
@#$ $#@ They won't have pickets around the base either? #$%
@#$ $#@ Renegade detected. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you just have to convince someone to live in your bag. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't need a bag to be the team healer. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least I'd be safe from zombies in the cockpit for a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't pick the key myself, but keeping the lock intact would be pretty useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Said only Wii U owner #$%
@#$ $#@ What base? #$%
@#$ $#@ Any such location will be a priority for anyone who has actual access to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The heavier the security the more problematic it will be to gain access. #$%
@#$ $#@ I already assume zombies will be like blue whenever I think of the zombie apocalypse. #$%
@#$ $#@ They can just block projectiles with the force like neo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even then, raider groups have a tendency to become organized and more humane as time goes on. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a raider group appeared that managed to dominate an entire area and destablize all other forms of resistance they would eventually have to develop rules between themselves in order to assure their own survival. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, I just wanted to know if you were ex-military. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm thinking of breaking into a building with metal doors and bar locks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Padlocks really aren't that useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Baltimore happened because those people were thinking about the next two weeks. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they thought the world would end because of their riot nobody, not even the niggest nigger would be out there screaming their heads off. #$%
@#$ $#@ dumb faggot detected #$%
@#$ $#@ When it says loaf I assume it's at least as large as pic related. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, a loaf. #$%
@#$ $#@ he was referring to the blood of the zombie getting all over you. #$%
@#$ $#@ What if you cut it and carried stuff in it like a stretcher? #$%
@#$ $#@ What if I turned it inside out? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do zombies decompose normally in every option besides blue? #$%
@#$ $#@ I should've mentioned that without blue zombies take anywhere from 4 months to 3 years to decompose. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Inside" is relative. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's decent for a launch title. #$%
@#$ $#@ It desperately needs a sequel to flesh out its concepts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shame we'll most likely never get one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, fresh water and bread would help a lot but you would still need to scavenge for shit as a loaf of bread and 500ml is fucking nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am Legend the book is red, the vampires know where he lives and they constantly stand outside trying to get him to come out. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't need to defend myself daily though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless you're some kind of retard running into other peoples camps you're gonna need to defend yourself once in a blue moon at worst. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just avoid the zombies and the looters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why don't they stop asking me to open the door? #$%
@#$ $#@ I can hear them right outside Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lightsabers can break down any door #$%
@#$ $#@ Grocery carts are noisy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill Jesus and take the bottle and bag. #$%
@#$ $#@ This tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Grocery carts are hardly noisy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Outside you'd have to be within 20 feet to hear one, which is easily in sight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to a supermarket parking lot with a friend sometime and have him push a grocery cart 20+ feet from you and see if you can hear much through the wind/ambient noise. #$%
@#$ $#@ In dead island i believe there is some monsters that infest humans but don't kill them leaving them to utter "help me" over and over #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the only way for us humans to work together; whether you like it not. #$%
@#$ $#@ If we all work together, we can overcome anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'll be our true test of adversity. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about Summer Lesson for 1 month? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're away 99% of buildings are easy as piss to break into by just removing one window right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then all you have to do is block/board that window and you own that building. #$%
@#$ $#@ Project zomboid is the best, followed by 7 days to die. #$%
@#$ $#@ All that has to happen is you accidentally push the on button while it's in your pocket or backpack and you're sliced in half instantly. #$%
@#$ $#@ it only takes one swing to the neck, genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just bag shitposters unable to cope with starvation and delirium after they realize they can't digest bags. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want a way in you might as well just take the lightsaber. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why settle for a key that only opens doors when you can open anything anywhere + kill infinite zombies during the week? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what the seem to be doing in most fucking stories. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you a master of manufacturing everything you need in real life? #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean the 100% mind and body perk? #$%
@#$ $#@ It sounds good at first, but scavenging in the middle of the night is generally a pretty dumb idea since zombies don't sleep and you don't have night vision. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too few 'safe' night scenarios to rely on it for that purpose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Turn it off? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to /cyoa/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Each time you use it through you'd be progressing your hunger/thirst by 6-8 hours, and unless you're an ultra marathoner you'd be tired of walking in a few hours, so that would require you to use it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'd be eating like 3 days of food per day. #$%
@#$ $#@ literally none of those things are hard #$%
@#$ $#@ Then good choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah you could, if you're in an apartment and need to get out just stay on the first floor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting overwhelmed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cut a door into a wall and go outside. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only siths deal with safety features. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck catching someone who can cut through any wall they want and leave anytime? #$%
@#$ $#@ change that shit to vice vesa #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean either you want batman or t-800. #$%
@#$ $#@ Batman with bullshit mary sue powers activated can't be beaten, and t-800 could just kill everything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the emergency situations that kill you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something that gets you out of a lethal jam is worth 1000 luxuries. #$%
@#$ $#@ No time at all since it's a light saber that can cut through pretty much anything instantly? #$%
@#$ $#@ The bag is still limited in space. #$%
@#$ $#@ No you can't hold everything you could ever need in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Key would be really great in a city, but in an apocalyptic scenario you'd probably want to get out highly populated areas anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, why haven't you invented a lightsaber equivalent in real life anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ It should weigh maybe 1 pound, be able to cut through anything instantly, and have infinite power. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound like a child who visits /o/ and /diy/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Take a laser pointer, wave it at a wall to make a you sized hole. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it takes you more than 10 seconds, you're probably retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Choco Tacos. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is it, what I've been waiting for. #$%
@#$ $#@ in a manga, I am a hero they are kinda like red button, scares the shit out of me tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ ur a chav, lol #$%
@#$ $#@ It cuts through thick metal in seconds, most buildings these days are made out of weak brick and plywall. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rest and food was tempting but the bag would be incredibly useful.Could fit a tent weapon food and clothes in the bag atleast and have room for comfort items. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really want the source on this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you shoving down walls over and over? #$%
@#$ $#@ You go out one wall and run away if you need to. #$%
@#$ $#@ And you're a sheltered idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you shouting that you have no practical knowledge and only watch the science channel. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is no need, my hearing is fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ ...and toast their bread! #$%
@#$ $#@ who is this sperm worm #$%
@#$ $#@ Star wars materials are way stronger than our materials. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have thousands of years of history for inventing things to counter lightsabers. #$%
@#$ $#@ We have buildings designed to resist the basic elements. #$%
@#$ $#@ The way you say that like it's a bad thing belies your utter ignorance and sheltered lifestyle, basement dweller. #$%
@#$ $#@ In know of the podcast "We're Alive" that does this fairly well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or flamethrowers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your point? #$%
@#$ $#@ People who use guns in a zombie situation are gonna have fucktons of zombies on their faces. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had no plans to fight other humans, just use the saber to kill zombies if need be or as a skeleton key. #$%
@#$ $#@ This whole thread is about arguing over zombie survival items, you dipshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one has mentioned zombi poo since the first 10 posts. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a really well coordinated person, I don't trip on the infinite black ice during the winter, I don't think I'm gonna trip on some brick that I can easily see. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to a Samus Aran, but I know it's p. #$%
@#$ $#@ much impossible. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll settle with hooking her up with master chief and getting my own Cortana out of the deal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isaac Clarke is a cook dude and I wish him happiness. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do I have to be a lone person? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you implying people wouldn't want to work with someone who had a god mode weapon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause that's how I would use it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Walls aren't 6 feet thick anon, stepping over a wall isn't hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ In fact the average wall is a foot thick, if you can't step over that you're actually retarded. #$%

@#$ $#@ You could use the lightsaber to tunnel under them and directly into the armory. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dirt/concrete/etc blocks sound pretty well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not like a lightsaber is super loud or that tunneling with one would cause a lot of sound unless it collapsed on you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did. #$%
@#$ $#@ However, a tiny arm has a lot of uses! #$%
@#$ $#@ I plan on using it as a back scratcher. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm more excited for that swanky leather looking case than the arm. #$%
@#$ $#@ It true that Japan is getting a full size one? #$%
@#$ $#@ You think it will go for more than 99 bucks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, the only reason I ended up snagging one off amazon was because some anon posted they were up. #$%
@#$ $#@ It only lasted 10-15 minutes I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it depends. #$%
@#$ $#@ For an actual limited release, I would guess they only release x number to those sellers and don't make any more. #$%
@#$ $#@ But who knows. #$%
@#$ $#@ buying 2 arms and a digital edition #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you going to do with two arms? #$%
@#$ $#@ If Sega released a phone case gimmick of the motion tracker, I would buy two, honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the game industry only realized how retarded some fanboys are they could be so much richer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm going to be jealous of your unopened arm box, five years from now. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it's Gray Fox's arm, less so. #$%
@#$ $#@ epic meme my friend ;^ #$%
@#$ $#@ nandesuka sore ha xD #$%
@#$ $#@ name 17 games that do this #$%
@#$ $#@ draw a transformice mouse with a mouse #$%
@#$ $#@ It's alright, I still draw with a mouse too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Request you get a tablet and stop tracing images. #$%
@#$ $#@ Requesting a nude Anna Williams stretching her limbs before a rigorous lovemaking session #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty good for a mouse. #$%
@#$ $#@ whoops, didn't mean to quote that guy, meant to quote the OP #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice, would cuddle #$%
@#$ $#@ Vanilla sex of Pit and Viridi #$%
@#$ $#@ What's your preferred genre? #$%
@#$ $#@ Viridi trying to be sexy #$%
@#$ $#@ viridi getting vaginally fisted by phosphora? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I have a yuri request, but it's not KI related sadly... #$%
@#$ $#@ Palutena hugging Phosphora from behind as she gropes her breast with one hand, fingers her with the other, and kisses her neck. #$%
@#$ $#@ jump jump! #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd be happy with anything at this point, for me non-lewd deliveries are great no matter what unless they're scribblechan tier #$%
@#$ $#@ It's happened before, yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ If you mean a game that isn't out yet, maybe? #$%
@#$ $#@ People draw Red Ass and Mighty Number 9 stuff before release. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yo, not in a rude way, just game dev POV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Besides general body composition, isn't that sprite a bit too messy color-wise? #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like it has a lot of details to keep consistent for movement. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could just be me for making 16 bit shit, but seems like a difficult sprite to work with. #$%
@#$ $#@ who's the girl on the far right? #$%
@#$ $#@ she's cute #$%
@#$ $#@ I realized that. #$%
@#$ $#@ the guys over at /agdg/ noted this as well, I'm gonna try to simplify this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe I'll use this for dialogue portraits or something #$%
@#$ $#@ So you want a drawing of the character in that sprite? #$%
@#$ $#@ There was an attempt #$%
@#$ $#@ sorry, please have a bunch of bad pixelings #$%
@#$ $#@ And i appreciate it, thank you! #$%
@#$ $#@ Too me, it seems to small for a portrait, and too big for animation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try drawing what your character would look like from really far away, as in, dropping whatever small details can be forgotten without the character being lost. #$%
@#$ $#@ Works for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm really torn on how big the canvas should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ 32x32 or smaller? #$%
@#$ $#@ It depends on the kind of game. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you wanted something like a fighter, than 64 and up is ok. #$%
@#$ $#@ But a platformer or top down game, 32 or 16 is an alright bet, depending on how much you need to see at once. #$%
@#$ $#@ just give up already #$%
@#$ $#@ That's alright, nobody ever requests males, and if you need to draw straight sex you can just make a vague shape with a dick attached. #$%
@#$ $#@ erase the chest and slap a dick and balls on there #$%
@#$ $#@ Work in progress... #$%
@#$ $#@ I like this too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Viridi pressing her boobs against Pit's back, as sexual tension reaches breaking point #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh gosh. #$%
@#$ $#@ PALUTENA 69 WITH MEDUSA #$%
@#$ $#@ Medusa doing this page to Pit. #$%
@#$ $#@ There ya go, champ. #$%
@#$ $#@ That looks much better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not OR. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fix it some more by giving Paula some fat tits #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, and thanks for taking it even if the delivery wasn't serious. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I draw this will you promise to never ever ask for it again? #$%
@#$ $#@ don't put it past an autist to come back endlessly reposting a different request #$%
@#$ $#@ Gud wurk mang, I'd say you should finish it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Finish it, I love the Lissa/Owain/Ophelia family tree line. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do it, do it for the children and grandchildren. #$%
@#$ $#@ Palutena holding Pit down, and snowballing him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once again, great work! #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you very much #$%
@#$ $#@ Pony up the money for a tablet anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people work with what they got. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice job, I thought Hannigan was cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think her top lip sticks out too much, or rather her cheek is too far back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might just be my preference though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really, personally I think it looks, well, ugly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Execution is fantastic, but I just dont like the style. #$%
@#$ $#@ and what idea would that be ..? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't remember. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I remembered, I would've posted it. #$%
@#$ $#@ OR here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't notice that until comparing the two of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the fix. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather commission that, honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad it was not you. #$%
@#$ $#@ PAD or Terra Battle? #$%
@#$ $#@ Inklings are so last month. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldn't Ash just push Lili out of the way? #$%
@#$ $#@ He'd get more dick that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's literally just your waifu bacon #$%
@#$ $#@ I really love all the detail of this but I feel like adding a little more to the face and neck might help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better than people asking for Peach over and over. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also play PAD and I do like the art of the game but you gotta admit that a lot of the character designs are pretty complicated. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have a lot of details. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't blame them not getting picked up for a multitude of reasons, sadly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who are some of your favorites from there? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dressed as Teddie? #$%
@#$ $#@ What's PAD, anyhow #$%
@#$ $#@ How about Teddy as a teddy bear? #$%
@#$ $#@ That'd just be Teddie then! #$%
@#$ $#@ The kid looks off tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Peach doesn't look like her face got smashed against a wall. #$%
@#$ $#@ Puzzle and Dragons. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can just go to an edit thread and ask people to convert peach into daisy if thats what you desire, since they are practically the same #$%
@#$ $#@ Not with the head unzipped! #$%
@#$ $#@ awesome friend!, finally some love to this great games! #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you #$%
@#$ $#@ They can't handle fros? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why don't you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Daisy is generally meatier. #$%
@#$ $#@ And the entire idea is that Daisy is so desperate to be popular that she is a massive slut for attention so she goes full overslut. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't believe that sort of thing isn't more popular. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ya think? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was feeling better about him than about Cadence. #$%
@#$ $#@ requesting Iza hairjob #$%
@#$ $#@ Congratulations, you removed her sex appeal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bombman looking at he dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Ha yep lewd enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but you speak like all breasts are the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ His face really doesn't look like himself #$%
@#$ $#@ Go for it #$%
@#$ $#@ You also got them baby hands #$%
@#$ $#@ her breasts look saggy as a grandmas and her body type is entirely different from the reference. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ The lines are nice but the actual piece is pretty bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just sayin. #$%
@#$ $#@ I prefer the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ Als stop /ic/ing drawfags with half-assed redlines that look like crap, I don't want you to scare them away man. #$%
@#$ $#@ She reminds me of scarjo for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ What would you know? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, it's good to be able to take critique. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have to agree with it but it's good to have another opinion. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm cackling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you, sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont say its wrong, you say its right. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont have to think something is good or bad to know its got problems that can be fixed, drawfag wont know these problems unless you tell them. #$%
@#$ $#@ quick sketch #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the laugh. #$%
@#$ $#@ I needed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please finish this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm actually someone else, and I don't mind that you prefer the original, but it's good to get different opinions on things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes you won't see something until some one points it out to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop posting this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tons of people make multiple requests. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know that ain't gonna stop him or anything right? #$%
@#$ $#@ All of the above apparently. #$%
@#$ $#@ He already got the first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heh, nice work! #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice assumptions, I'm not the one making the request. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know anything about a Fi request #$%
@#$ $#@ All different ones #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a novelty, drawthread always had one or two cunts that flood the threads with their shitty requests. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just look at the filenames of most requests. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only pick new requests I've never seen in the last threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ I understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did not know he received any deliveries. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought you were angry that he was making multiple requests. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you draw by any chance? #$%
@#$ $#@ Could I see some of your work if you do? #$%
@#$ $#@ woo hope rising #$%
@#$ $#@ something quick and kinda shitty #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it honestly matter? #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasn't even an offensive comment. #$%
@#$ $#@ The file names are not guaranteed to be the same person if its something easily plucked from websites like the League of Legends site or the actual game wiki or pedias that host them, so that is still a gamble. #$%
@#$ $#@ But generally that is a good idea long as its not mainstream stuff that can be pulled off easy on the first google search for stuff like League of Legends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh you're the guy who said you take requests then did that "Request" than just turned it into something entirely different and loosely related, yep definitely not someone i want to request from. #$%
@#$ $#@ So you'll stop asking now right? #$%
@#$ $#@ He wanted her kimono dragon-esque, not her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean good job but unless you fix the face I dont think it'll stop. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've critiqued less experienced artists too. #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem with this piece is that it doesn't feel stylistically cohesive. #$%
@#$ $#@ The details are great but since most people are so focused on that, they overlook other stuff like the thin neck and the left side of the face not showing as much as it should from this angle. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes her look alien. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could probably get away with thin neck and big head in an anime style, but since this is more realistic, we should expect regular proportions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Posts like this are the reason why nobody ever makes constructive critiques and lewd requests with fucked up proportions are hailed like the second coming of Christ. #$%
@#$ $#@ requesting this cartoonishly overdone, like AND THEN YOU EXPLODE levels #$%
@#$ $#@ Not those guys, but that's pretty much a given sign. #$%
@#$ $#@ The redlines were kinda cringeworthy tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't unsee. #$%
@#$ $#@ OR here, this is hilarious and definitely not what I was expecting as is but you should totally finish it #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you think some people create drama? #$%
@#$ $#@ European time drawthreads are more quiet. #$%
@#$ $#@ i just wanted to draw something quick... #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes they're way too quiet for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes please ! #$%
@#$ $#@ No Quattro clone who's name I've forgotten. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kekked, good job #$%
@#$ $#@ Hah, glorious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not OR #$%
@#$ $#@ i think we don't have to find out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Strange, I too wonder that all the time on /d/. #$%
@#$ $#@ then i did a jood job #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok, maties. #$%
@#$ $#@ i'm down for more images of nate/marisa but why the two #$%
@#$ $#@ bacon, you;ve done it again, great stuff #$%
@#$ $#@ God bless you, Bacon #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad you guys like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ seconding, adding on that it should probably be behind her bar, or maybe in that gold guy's room #$%
@#$ $#@ I like your request, if it makes a difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope this one will be the next OP image. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really like what this drawing is going for. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately the detail in the background is... #$%
@#$ $#@ The detail on Paula is good though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Flatchested women detected. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a fan. #$%
@#$ $#@ More like 10 years old girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disgusting Cow Tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's been dead since someone threw a fit about it #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, it's fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I won't ask for a while, if you think it's bothering you then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone do this with Joule and Lumen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Joule and Moniqa, that also works. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get you like it but i can't think of any character who fits that well. #$%
@#$ $#@ In this image, it stands for Delicious Cow Tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ But it also refers to Disgusting Cow Tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why you let one person have so much power anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lilith / Morrigan #$%
@#$ $#@ Your shit tastes should be a punishable offense. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm uncreative gimme outfit ideas #$%
@#$ $#@ This can be done with Jeanne and Bayonetta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any extremely flat chested girl in clothes that make it clear how flatchested she is next to another girl that is obviously stacked and showing a lot of cleavage/underboob/etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ I do like them a lot, but not to the point of pestering others. #$%
@#$ $#@ One should be a loli anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how the meme works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you the same drawfriend working on that schoolgirl squidboi reach-around image? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that even how "Nyan" is spelled in Japanese? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shouldn't it be "Nya" and "n"? #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't mean I wouldn't I just can't think of a /v/ character immediately . #$%
@#$ $#@ headpat's cool with any character, especially Ramlethal, iirc #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not the original artist, just a passing drawfag trying my hand at understanding proper critique and help #$%
@#$ $#@ anyone is good. #$%
@#$ $#@ do you have a series you like to draw? #$%
@#$ $#@ maybe something from that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Former or latter? #$%
@#$ $#@ Requesting an extreme close up of this fucker, creepy smile and all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not fresh enough bruh #$%
@#$ $#@ Shorts and stockings or any of nice socks or leggings is a starter, If that's not your thing theres always spats or lingerie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can never really go wrong with just wearing an apron either. #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant like in game outfits but wow that's cute #$%
@#$ $#@ I drew it really fast and the someone else commented on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mhm, yes! #$%
@#$ $#@ Barf all over my butt cheeks, daddy! #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi iggs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, that'd be the only situation I'd probably like it in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Different anon, i just think squatting girls are cute, lewd or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't even understand what you just typed. #$%
@#$ $#@ You like editing official artwork? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sure Tim Buckley does that, you dont want to be Tim Buckley, not even Tim Buckley wants to be Tim Buckley. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go home, Tim #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't do that but that doesn't sound too bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ My eyes usually don't match up well so I need to work on it but I think I'd prefer to just freehand both still. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh wow thanks! #$%
@#$ $#@ Fair enough, just curious to see a divide. #$%
@#$ $#@ working on it #$%
@#$ $#@ What is she from? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, how about Peach in a bikini? #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt that has ever been done before. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope people don't still fall for this shit #$%
@#$ $#@ dont lie just to kill the thread anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Take your salt elsewhere, you fucking passive aggressive baby. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you do Meia from Alundra please? #$%
@#$ $#@ Bathing in a lake #$%
@#$ $#@ Calm down christ. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only proper response to shitposting is to shitpost yourself anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give it time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Request more characters to get impified. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only character I wanted imped was Tear, and I got a really nice delivery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Barring trying to get her in a bikini or naked apron or something, I'm good. #$%
@#$ $#@ So what do you want, someone to request "Daisy just standing there"? #$%
@#$ $#@ Draw sniper wolf having a snipe off with Snake #$%
@#$ $#@ Half of all Nintendo requests and deliveries are STRAIGHT UP furry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why should this bother people? #$%
@#$ $#@ Something with Katherine I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ And can you give examples of non-waifufag activities? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to brainstorm ideas? #$%
@#$ $#@ Recommend some games. #$%
@#$ $#@ what kinda stuff do you like? #$%
@#$ $#@ i haven't been able to figure out your likes just based off your deliveries #$%
@#$ $#@ Hooray for being in the exact same boat #$%
@#$ $#@ Are monster girls turned more monstrous fine as well? #$%
@#$ $#@ When in doubt, ink it up #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna see Fi as a Yuki-onna #$%
@#$ $#@ Just find a request you think is stupid and monkeypaw it. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this okay? #$%
@#$ $#@ i kinda did, ty.so i'll look for one splatton request #$%
@#$ $#@ How about an extra monstrous Naga Siren? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the way you think, too bad said scenarios are few and far between. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try something you don't know of and look up the series, there's a lot of good games in these threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ This character drawn with a more monstrous appearance #$%
@#$ $#@ are you torielfag? #$%
@#$ $#@ A baron of hell and doomguy arm wrestling. #$%
@#$ $#@ ohh ok. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't take this serious but i'll suggest a Smug Inkling watching Animal planet or Discovery Channel, and an optional bottle of lotion. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't want to cause any offense with my request #$%
@#$ $#@ You can try drawing them in a non anime style. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I already drew something like that #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep the big eyes! #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to see how creepy it gets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres some level of irony when you pick Riven after saying you see anime when RIven is Anime as fuck in design, right down to her being based upon Marth, the ultimate being a shout out to Inuyasha and so so. #$%
@#$ $#@ New Thread #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, i just realized that ... #$%
@#$ $#@ is just that seeing anime character doesn´t invite me to search for their games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lol on the other hand, i a game that i played, and it grew on me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Earthbound has to best fanart. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being a mother 1 fan feels kind of empty #$%
@#$ $#@ requesting Snake showing samus' ass why hes called "the legendary solid snake" aka pounding her tight ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad you liked it Anon~ #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like someone didn't follow the rules #$%
@#$ $#@ You mind if I start dropping requests for her like doing a naked apron and stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ If not thats cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ naked apron is an oxymoron... #$%
@#$ $#@ Blame the Japanese. #$%
@#$ $#@ So why can't an anime game grow on you? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're being silly, also anime or not it doesn't every carry in your style because it isn't the same style. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've found games here I didn't like when seeing it but I ended up liking them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll just blame the guy who keeps posting that same reference #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you keep falling for the bait? #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, Ni no Kuni would had been Nocturne levels of great if your monster had an style similar to the bosses instead of being kinder surprise toys #$%
@#$ $#@ No one acknowledged it in the last thread, so he will keep posting it in a desperate attempt to feel like his time wasn't wasted making it. #$%
@#$ $#@ the 360 has the largest community out of any of the platforms. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also has the most skilled on average. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whether or not you get fair matchups depends on what you search in ranked, which usually works well enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also 6kpp on PC is about equivalent to 2k on xbox. #$%
@#$ $#@ you should be thankful you get paired up against the same people. #$%
@#$ $#@ what the fuck does hat even mean, more impactful my ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, to be fair, all the boss fights in DXHR were outsourced, they weren't actually done by Eidos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Witcher 2 had choices that matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ and even then they were completely trivialized by the Typhoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's usage in boss fights didn't even break Pacifist runs. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok where? #$%
@#$ $#@ Never said it did. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not even hyped for MD. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any further DX titles are just milking and the fact that it's coming to consoles isn't really a good sign. #$%
@#$ $#@ So you're saying they should stop making Deus Ex games? #$%
@#$ $#@ Let it die. #$%
@#$ $#@ No need to taint one of the greatest videogames ever with console and new gaming cancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ you are a little to late for this rant, it happened in 2003 #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay friend, enjoy your transsexuals in Deus Ex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this fucking bait? #$%
@#$ $#@ Deus Ex was designed and built from the ground up for PC, and then ported to PS2 two years later #$%
@#$ $#@ that one destroy everything is confirmed to be canon ending #$%
@#$ $#@ It better not be fucking optional in the same sense boss fights were optional in Deus Ex because that was bs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but, "conspiracy Theory" worked for me in HR. #$%
@#$ $#@ This whole corporate spionage was fantastic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mankind Divided is basically a reboot in all but name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Witcher 2 also had at least one skippable boss fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Missing Link the one they made in house rather than getting another studio to do the boss fights was awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Natsume's too busy with Harvest Moon to harvest Medabots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kids are where the money is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Outside of Japan kids don't know about Medabots, only the old fucks that watched the show back when it was shown do. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's not enough of them to really be worth it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I'm saying is they need a new show. #$%
@#$ $#@ DLC from the 7th game. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol what a gay #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't blame him since Kojima sacked him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd be drinking profusely too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank god the pokemon run is not a boring ass glitched any% run that's like 5 minutes long. #$%

@#$ $#@ This triggered me #$%
@#$ $#@ Several Metroid games have endings that let you choose to save or kill some animals. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a popular bid war every single GDQ. #$%

@#$ $#@ Sleep tight, Pizza. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you watched the run that got put up recently on SDA it uses memory hacking to get all 151 by making certain encounters happen and editing the species of encountered pokemon on the fly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's more because they're long as shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Link the full list #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't people feel embarrassed wearing these? #$%
@#$ $#@ Might as well grow a pair and just go barefoot. #$%

@#$ $#@ You think human overpopulation is better than pet overpopulation. #$%

@#$ $#@ Did you take the knot? #$%
@#$ $#@ at first i didnt get that your point was that pet owners are right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well Im using my robot butler. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some random mangy mutt that's pushed onto you doesn't compare to a robot that waits the entire apocalypse to see you again. #$%
@#$ $#@ A butlers role is to guard the fort. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck would I bring him with me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes gonna be my settlements steward and rule with an Iron Claw while Im gone. #$%
@#$ $#@ good, don't forget next time #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a difference between making your character better and using an invincible companion that puts your easy game in ultra easy mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every game should have some challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont actually know how to do anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every game they make is just a series of flukes. #$%
@#$ $#@ GRAPHICS GRAPHICS GRAPHICS ALL YOU PCFAGS TALK ABOUT IS GRAPHICS GRAPHICS DON'T MATTER THEY NEVER MATTERED THAT'S WHY XBOX ONE IS THE BEST #$%

@#$ $#@ Theres many ways to break the difficulty in every fallout game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will play as I want to play and you can do whatever the fuck you want that makes you feel so big and hardcore for playing an RPG with easy combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can play however you want but you should know that youre a casual faggot if you use that dog. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like my tits have power ; #$%
@#$ $#@ You should know that if youre playing F4 youre already playing a casual ass game and trying to act smug and superior because youre hardcore about it is fucking laughable. #$%
@#$ $#@ post that screencap #$%
@#$ $#@ feeling good yet faggot? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never said Im going to play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're not only playing the most casual game of the year but you're also using a huge crutch. #$%

@#$ $#@ Thats bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its only 6 inch flaccid 12 inch erect #$%
@#$ $#@ It's player's choice for stages #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey the better Wario won there man, no mistake about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't plan on listening to him #$%
@#$ $#@ If they taunt after a good kill, its okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ But these fucker just charges smashes and try to spike every single kill, so probably a good kill wont actually happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, shit, who were you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think I meant it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry if I made you mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since thats based on the System country selection, and NoA being oh so supportive of anything that isnt USA, most people just select USA as their country and youd get the exact same tourney as all of these. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Mexicans are americans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, I don't add Shittle Mac players #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all americans have a good connection, simply just using wifi is enough to shit up matches. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the free win #$%
@#$ $#@ You like my g-drof reads? #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is why you ban walk-offs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Wuhu Island and Pilotwings. #$%
@#$ $#@ As pink kong, Im sorry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whys that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun to play with nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ What's your name so I can pick Viridi every time im in a lobby with you #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's Y #$%
@#$ $#@ I had to go spam crazy towards the end, the dong just would not slumber #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even seem spammy to me, you just dominated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, it sucks that replays are not saved by default for a period of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I lost some fucking gold today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you lucina?? #$%
@#$ $#@ SF games do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was me v lucina whilst you and other toon link were fighting #$%
@#$ $#@ That was good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taunted out of respect #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I got banned for holding my arrow or "idling" who won? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was just about to pick Virid too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could have been the battle of the QTs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking blew it. #$%
@#$ $#@ suck my dick tbh fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry Bro I wanted to kill you due to the bike spam near the end #$%
@#$ $#@ I-I didnt mean too! #$%
@#$ $#@ I ch-chose Palutenas Temple OMEGA, i had no idea more vehicles would be in the fight #$%
@#$ $#@ No just you #$%
@#$ $#@ That was one reason for the SD. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other reason is that it was too obvious that you were going to beat my ass, so I just used it as an excuse to get the fuck out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause you have a really good Lucina. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh no? #$%
@#$ $#@ I got 6th m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Well then youre just good in general. #$%
@#$ $#@ No wonder youre randoming. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wanted REEEEEvenge #$%
@#$ $#@ Yep, it says 3rd with 103 points and shits not updating. #$%
@#$ $#@ It barely matters though if Im up a place or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone sounds salty :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ Or were all trying to be tryhard but we are shit #$%
@#$ $#@ and australians #$%
@#$ $#@ my moment has arrived #$%
@#$ $#@ gg man, gg #$%
@#$ $#@ o-one hour only?! #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno. #$%
@#$ $#@ In Sm4sh, as with anything, "tryhard" doesn't mean you're a good player trying to win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its someone who sucks all the fun and style out of it, spamming projectiles and wearing the other out or constantly resorting to the same, hyper-viable combos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre not always even tough opponents, just a real pain in the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok then... #$%
@#$ $#@ Tourney isnt on 3DS, but go to /ssbg/, they do 3DS matches there, singles and dubs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just go lucas, lets all be Lucas. #$%
@#$ $#@ How does it feel knowing that a Viridi fag beat you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't even use Lucas but he's so much fun to play as. #$%
@#$ $#@ But when everyones Lucas...no one will be. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know however i will live now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably commit sudoku. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck of Syndrome #$%
@#$ $#@ lol what a gay #$%
@#$ $#@ His f-smash has longer range than Shulks f-smash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really dont want to 1v1 right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I must just really suck with Falcon then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your point stands well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone popped in right after you left. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got stuck 1v1ing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really dont like using Sheik. #$%
@#$ $#@ It feels cheap #$%
@#$ $#@ What happened? #$%
@#$ $#@ Candy, I presume? #$%
@#$ $#@ I did. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Kirbys fair is that three hit thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ It ends in 58 minutes #$%
@#$ $#@ Uhh definintely not me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a fucking tourney fag even though I use Palutena. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's over in about an hour #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably Czar. #$%
@#$ $#@ He had the shit connection, so let's just assume #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuccboi is his personal lapdog and makes sure to target anyone who goes after him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad that I haven't run into those fags #$%
@#$ $#@ I am fuccboi. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just went after anyone who was left on the ground because I couldnt deal with that faggot on the platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then use the rope snake #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not playing in lag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Simple as that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would they draw his chin that way? #$%
@#$ $#@ YEAH Lets go lets go! #$%
@#$ $#@ I have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont pick it because only the Omega version is good, and there are better Final Destinations to choose from than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill probably choose it more as I play in this tourney. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry, you're not alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got three-stocked by that guy playing a Mega Man Mii. #$%
@#$ $#@ yess yess. #$%
@#$ $#@ ill add you #$%
@#$ $#@ all of the above #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you, Marth should have had that but he seemed to get sloppy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes not as safe with his endlag as Ike so his spacing must be on point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why I use Ike in these things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Max rage plus the highest knockback counter. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was the Link being a faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont normally play that way, but you made me salty as fuck in that previous match when I was ZSS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats your point? #$%
@#$ $#@ I play a lot of characters that arent fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just ask anybody who plays against my Kirby. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever helps you sleep at night, son. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play however you want, your ZSS was just not good with those dive kicks and random smashes. #$%
@#$ $#@ no it doesnt help me sleep because im here lying in bed with bloodshot eyes telling you that you are a faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I alone here #$%
@#$ $#@ Shitposting is against the rules anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prove me wrong, cuntnugget. #$%

@#$ $#@ What Steven universe even about? #$%
@#$ $#@ why the fuck are you posting Steven Shitnverse here? #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck right back off to tumblr please #$%
@#$ $#@ Perry as a close second. #$%
@#$ $#@ She great. #$%
@#$ $#@ this tbh fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Its kinda like Powerpuff Girls but more LGBT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking cute girls #$%
@#$ $#@ Be more rocksalty, clod. #$%
@#$ $#@ you know how most shows are a young boy going on adventures growing up is about them becoming a man? #$%
@#$ $#@ well this is about a young boy growing in to a woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ other than that gay rock sex #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, ill work with you /co/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there moments here where this mom-figure as I understand it hints at some /ss/ with the steven kid? #$%
@#$ $#@ If this show can scratch that cougar scratch, then Ill give it a watch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lesbian space rocks, enough tears to fill the ocean, songs of varying quality, some light body horror and cute shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I'd watch the shit out of Cena Universe #$%
@#$ $#@ That show was serious hit or miss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of the best episodes, and some that I couldn't give a shit about #$%
@#$ $#@ Jews use the LOLsoRANDOMxD Adventure Time formula to push their SJW agenda on little children. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree but i still loved the shit out of it #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this satisfy you? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is fine #$%
@#$ $#@ My excuse is that I like it and the fandom doesnt bother me that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is the one I saw, but I thought it was taken out of context. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its definitely intriguing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this about it in terms of examples? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know very little about the show so I was thinking they might have done the "I only look like a prepubescent child" thing like pic related. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree bb #$%
@#$ $#@ How about this? #$%
@#$ $#@ GOING FAST #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to kill myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is "any show that gets popular ever since MLP". #$%
@#$ $#@ Truly a shame, some of the reaction images are perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did /co/ have to get infested by tumblr users? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then instead of being a bitch about it, just use them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're just trying to find a reason to start a Stephen Universe thread aren't you #$%
@#$ $#@ Talking about them on the internet #$%
@#$ $#@ The "tumblr" things that are in the show don't mind me that much, really #$%
@#$ $#@ Well i would hope not you seem like a nice guy anon! #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rather not use them in threads with decent discussions, I know autists like that barney guy can derail a thread pretty quickly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I even avoid using anime reactions if im particularly vested or the thread is on the brink of becoming a shitfest. #$%
@#$ $#@ now you're talkin #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Mobile games #$%
@#$ $#@ I could imagine a Top-Down brawler. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure Clusters were created SPECIFICALLY so they'd have a goon-type enemy with infinite variation possibilities they could exploit in an eventual sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thread will either go 500+ posts or 404, so you might as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay then, be warned, I got this shit from tumblr so dont throw a fit. #$%
@#$ $#@ What, you dont like Ps1 models? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow that sounds fucking awful #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant wait until the indie scene moves away from 2D artstyles and goes to PS1/N64 era 3D. #$%
@#$ $#@ this would probably be a good throwaway game but CN Games would never shit out something of this quality #$%
@#$ $#@ think of it like a harem anime but instead of having multiple girlfriends or whatever the protagonist has multiple moms who are all sailor scouts in the sailor moon kind of sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ A man can dream. #$%
@#$ $#@ I forget that I need to come here and shitpost about them. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's more of the case where they actually need to put effort to pull off the PS1/2 graphics + the spooky atmosphere #$%
@#$ $#@ Each episode is only 11 minutes long, just watch it and form your own opinion. #$%
@#$ $#@ They made an anime about lina and crystal maiden? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its The World God Only Knows, all over again. #$%
@#$ $#@ 10-12, I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they include Bob #$%
@#$ $#@ Juri &gt; Sakura &gt; Chun-Li &gt; the rest &gt; Cammy &gt; Karin &gt; Mika #$%
@#$ $#@ They all have redeeming qualities and hot bodies which is more than you can say about most other casts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right there next to Chun-Li. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is No Sakura no buy a meme or is it pure dedication that Sakura is always the second post #$%
@#$ $#@ I really want Sakura. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cammy = Makoto = Sakura &gt; Everyone else #$%
@#$ $#@ Cummy a best, Chun is top too #$%
@#$ $#@ No Ingrid?, for shame #$%

@#$ $#@ Yeah, Lisa Lisa is pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best inspiration for a street fighter! #$%
@#$ $#@ Not as pure, though. #$%

@#$ $#@ Kinu Nishimuras art is the best. #$%

@#$ $#@ Agree with most things, Laura has potential to join the pretty good or even great tier depending on her trailer, i need to see her in movement and her voice etc.. #$%
@#$ $#@ all of them #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not too into that shit but probably elena her feet look enormous. #$%
@#$ $#@ No pantsu no buy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sakura was gloriously fuckig cute in sf4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Always made my peenus weenus hard :D #$%

@#$ $#@ I liked the old one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gave the feeling that despite all her pomp, her athleticism was her real pride. #$%

@#$ $#@ I would like to see this as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Drawthread drama sexually arouses me #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know what is or isnt possible, so Ill just ask that if you can do another version with cum it would be great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you mean giving a lap dance? #$%
@#$ $#@ But im an ungrateful prick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get horny while creating the work and I think that's the closest I've gotten. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the way to realize my dream, so of course I can't forget it! #$%
@#$ $#@ No not really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not unless its got my fetish in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What fetish is that, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Usually its just through sheer willpower. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love drawing that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having something good on repeat doesnt hurt though. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you listening to, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't know there were drawfags who would draw that sort of thing #$%
@#$ $#@ HEALTHY like shygal or you mean fat slobs #$%
@#$ $#@ This sounds cute, Ill give it a shot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was it the Sumia request? #$%
@#$ $#@ Vidya music, been listening to 3rd Strike and MvC tracks, in order to get the mood going for me at the moment. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gimme some time I'll sketch something up #$%
@#$ $#@ I spent way too much time to make this, enjoy #$%
@#$ $#@ B-but I want to do that request. #$%
@#$ $#@ WELL I GUESS YOU CAN'T NOW #$%
@#$ $#@ then go for it #$%
@#$ $#@ Good, thats a shit fetish #$%
@#$ $#@ Sweet dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ No but I will when I probably will sooner or later. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even OR, but I was hoping this would get done. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bless you, drawfriend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres a more accurate picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ not now, I have a few other things I wanna try and finish before I start any more request. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre still free to request it though since someone else might be able take the request. #$%
@#$ $#@ Color one of the shitty cakes hyper realistically and ill buy it. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Shadman doesnt draw for these threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well okay then. #$%
@#$ $#@ But its like this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with the community? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a fun game. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is the community? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't know, I turned off voice and text chat cause why wouldn't you? #$%
@#$ $#@ how is the community shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ So no different than any other online game #$%
@#$ $#@ I am that guy blasting music through the mic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though usually it is Glitch Hop. #$%
@#$ $#@ cause you're a fucking faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ No one played that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ people who say toxic are toxic #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if something with the same idea behind a gunblade will ever become viable in real world conflicts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like if our body armor became so advanced that our ballistic weaponry became useless, and to work around it we made lances that could pierce the armor and then shot bullets to blow whatever was stuck on the end clean off. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bayonetta #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga are you retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ I could when I was 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ Bayonetta is a hot chick who melts hearts, cums dicks and shoots other hearts of gay guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ there was a double barrel #$%
@#$ $#@ Sword/gun hybrids were a thing back when blackpowder weapons were becoming more popular. #$%
@#$ $#@ They werent very good, becoming worse than the individual parts because the balance of the weapon was thrown off. #$%
@#$ $#@ what do i fucking win #$%
@#$ $#@ those are badass, like better Raphael TMNT weapons. #$%
@#$ $#@ the sighs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Full length and sawed off. #$%
@#$ $#@ The latter. #$%
@#$ $#@ you don't treat a bayonet as a slashing/slicing tool though #$%
@#$ $#@ You also don't pull the trigger while you're using it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not intentionally anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bullet couldnt pas though armor but a pointy metal stick can... #$%
@#$ $#@ You slow or something or do you think blades are more deadly then a bullet cause your Japanese animes and COD knife kills? #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is a damn shame because of how elegant the original Monado design is #$%
@#$ $#@ So what is the point of the revolving chamber if there are no bullets in it? #$%
@#$ $#@ no we don't but for some reason it is still taught in every modern military boot camp cause muh traditions #$%
@#$ $#@ Its literally my favorite book of all time and you will see how it influenced everything from 40k to star wars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much any monhun weapon #$%
@#$ $#@ But Wakka can throw a beach ball overboard, towards the ocean, to hit a giant whale sized monster, AND have it bounce back towards the boat for him to catch it #$%
@#$ $#@ a larger mass with continuous force put behind it would have more penitrating power then a small balistic projectile with a set amount of force put behind it, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you slow or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is also in a hypothetical world where our armor makes bullets impractical, so arguing about semantics is pointless, its just an idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the whole point was that for whatever reasons long range bullets where no longer practical, so thats not really relivant #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga, have you been hit by a basketball, or baseball heading at you at high speeds? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now imagine that shit but not only with more weight, but with more force behind it. #$%
@#$ $#@ it holds the blank rounds that vibrate the blade. #$%
@#$ $#@ You never know when you need to slap a hoe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some military go on to CIA where hand to hand might be a little more important. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I am fighting a bird, Ill take the ball. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ballistic impacts work differently than impact from a blade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Knives actually go through ballistic vests relatively easily unless they hit a ceramic plate. #$%
@#$ $#@ We limited to /v/ here, or can we venture out to more retarded realms? #$%
@#$ $#@ Bullets are soft as shit and not sharp at all, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ But you have to admit its pretty badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but... #$%
@#$ $#@ Nunchucks are all stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw their potential, a high speed fun fest, but you'll hit yourself at least as much as you'll hit them, practicing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Badass means fuck all. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a weapon is well designed, and well balanced, then its badass to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Retarded over-design that fucks the entire weapon up to the point of uselessness is ugly. #$%
@#$ $#@ You throw it, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Vanilles weapon makes no sense though. #$%
@#$ $#@ so your implying physics in this type of thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre pretty goddamn stupid, know that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I got anime covered. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gee anon, you reckon that maybe different kinds of armors are resistant to different things? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you implying that in your magic fantasy world that the simple rules of throwing a fucking ball arent followed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not as good as the fans would have you believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has some neat concepts, but the first book does not explore them that much, and the series itself drags on too goddamn long. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything from any non-naturalistic RPG. #$%
@#$ $#@ hey man those knee nickles served an essential and valuable function #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what light sabers are for. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then it will advance to the point where they are shooting that material from guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ They will be called light guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ But light guns in star wars are useless against jedi. #$%
@#$ $#@ Speedwagon can make anything work. #$%
@#$ $#@ unless your Grievous or Boba Fett #$%
@#$ $#@ Those are blasters. #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont use the same tech and crystals that Jedi use. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you seriously calling Speedwagon retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im calling his hat retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the dumbest weapon in JoJo. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Caesar has fucking bubbles. #$%
@#$ $#@ When did grievous use a blaster? #$%
@#$ $#@ Third movie and animated series. #$%
@#$ $#@ he has like 2 of them and shoots Jedi with his free hands while they are busy blocking his light sabers #$%
@#$ $#@ He got killed by one. #$%
@#$ $#@ we #weaponizedhats now? #$%
@#$ $#@ this whole retarded debate was because the armor stopped bullets, but not the advanced spear, thus making spears practical again. #$%
@#$ $#@ So I think its safe to assume that the guy with the spear that can pierce the armor has the advantage over the guy who has a gun that cant. #$%
@#$ $#@ It really was a gimmick weapon in the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt there also a laser slingshot in one of the new cartoons? #$%
@#$ $#@ That seems pretty fucktarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, it was borderline useless to the point it couldnt even get pass stormtrooper armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ you know, the thing everyone makes fun of for being useless? #$%
@#$ $#@ He swapped it for a stungun bolted on his lightsaber. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought she was 12? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes 5 according to wikipedia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well that was easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off with your reddit anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ THE GREATEST MARTIAL ARTS #$%
@#$ $#@ Grievous is a cyborg, not a droid. #$%
@#$ $#@ He has free will. #$%
@#$ $#@ Civilized people chew their food. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigger this is the best gun in the game, git gud #$%
@#$ $#@ You do know most operators use plate carriers right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go Google "plate carrier" and after you do that go to bed, you have school tomorrow kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ but it looks so cool though #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone knows pigs don't know shit, why do you think that's a valid credential? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh you learned how to mace kids and beat women on your two week course so now your an expert? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off pig. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree that scythes are dumb as fuck when used as weapons but at least post an actual scythe that would be used for farming rather than the "weaponized" scythe which is more like a retarded spear. #$%
@#$ $#@ A chainsword would have made the game 10x better tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gunblades are fucking stupid from a design standpoint since they dont function at all like guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how they did the gunblade in Dissidia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Squall uses the momentum of the recoil to swing into another attack. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes a bit more sense that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ he is a shaman he uses it to control his familiar spirit's powers #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ She is M #$%
@#$ $#@ cool easter egg #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that far fetched man #$%
@#$ $#@ All the Daedric shit is purpose-built to be intimidating, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats actually really smart. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you meant sickles or the khopesh you're kinda pushing it because those were usually used to strike around or hook away shields #$%
@#$ $#@ Hurp, farming scythes and war scythes are different things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yep theres no reason not to use a mace instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or a flail. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get with the times grandpa, spears were favored in western europe since the middle ages ended. #$%
@#$ $#@ yea....if you're not a ninja #$%
@#$ $#@ No one agrees with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go home. #$%
@#$ $#@ I said PSO2s gunblades were better BECAUSE you can shoot. #$%
@#$ $#@ The "gun" part of FF8's gunblades didn't even need to exist in that form since you could just incorporate some sort of better designed mechanism for the explosion trigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chain allows for more centrifugal force and negates the force of the impact for the weilder? #$%
@#$ $#@ reminder that AC4 had pistolswords #$%
@#$ $#@ straight swords are for thrusting...you fucking morons #$%
@#$ $#@ Still wouldnt have mattered unless you half-sworded AND the opponent was prone. #$%
@#$ $#@ In which case why the fuck arent you using a superior weapon such as the Poleaxe? #$%
@#$ $#@ Daedric weapons and armor pre-skyrim at least looked functional and sensical #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what it also had? #$%
@#$ $#@ Starter weapons that were completely adequate for the entire game, giving you zero motivation to even look at what other options it had to offer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon the only things chainmails are good for are glancing and slashing blows. #$%
@#$ $#@ A spear thrust would have been a one hit kill if the user manged to get some decent force to their attack. #$%
@#$ $#@ That based on the Lewis machinegun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, rank and file legionnaires were the core of the roman army everyone else only filled the support role. #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on the style of bayonet. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about i kick a basketball as hard as i can at your face and see how much it fucks you up. #$%
@#$ $#@ well the guy using them was a huge fuckup who lost his duel against the feller with the sword #$%
@#$ $#@ Disney needs to sell toys anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ True, altough if you think about it, every single demon hunter dual glaive is just retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern day bayonets you do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marine Martial Arts teaches it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kids know how to read by 4 anon, and fluently by 5. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh yeah, at the Roman militarys peak, it was because of swords. #$%
@#$ $#@ The chaps in the second picture up to 290 AD used swords as their primary weapons, the Roman legionary had 2 javelins for throwing and limited anti-cavalry uses, but in hand to hand fighting, the Roman legionry during the era of expansion used swords primarily, spearmen were typically auxillaries and were support. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spears stopped being used by Roman citizen soldiers with the Marian reforms and the death of the manipular system, which even at that point only had the Triarii equipped with spears. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck the Roman legionary formation was famous for the ruthless stabbing the gladius could deliver on exposed midsections and sword arms/necks, all safely from behind their large shield and effective armour. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get learned nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Get fucking out of here summer child. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except /k/ actually made sense of the weapons from the Metro series. #$%
@#$ $#@ They had thread entirely dedicated to that because theyre in love with the luger action it uses. #$%
@#$ $#@ yah, but Metal Gears have always been kinda retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ Raiden sing handedly destroys like 20 of them in MGS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ There were a lot of things wrong with MGSV but I felt that sally was pretty much the same level of stupid as all the Metal Gears #$%
@#$ $#@ this is still the sexiest mofo around. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was discussed in tapes that it wasnt near ready to be deployed in combat but it was brought to life by mantis. #$%
@#$ $#@ still shit though #$%
@#$ $#@ The point of it was to be seen by the world and lead to fear, not for it to actually kill everyone #$%
@#$ $#@ mg rex is a qt #$%
@#$ $#@ well actually the real point was to deploy the language parasite to wipe out english #$%
@#$ $#@ wow headcanon is real #$%
@#$ $#@ Look up episode 51 on youtube. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cut content. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was included in collectors edition as a cutscene or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Google it. #$%
@#$ $#@ we are a mentally ill bb who developed an alter ego called "the medic" #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually pretty shit and the game makes that explicit at several points. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt Sahelanthropus just Rex standing upright? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was literally a toy, can't do shit on its own and was a child's plaything. #$%
@#$ $#@ They tried that too #$%
@#$ $#@ It's armor can turn into a 15kt nuke #$%
@#$ $#@ I CALL IT THE CHEMICAL BURGER #$%
@#$ $#@ I also remember taking forever with the huge ass giant three store tank-thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ What they should have done, was to just cut the whole "Liquid steals sahalantropussy" -part of the story and then they could have just had "Liquid and Psycho Kid ran away and no one gave a shit" and whole issue with cutting 51 would have been there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its for self defense in case of sabotage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even a dog like DD could take it out with a stun knife. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant even lie, bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ This one doesn't even look that cool #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean a wolf. #$%
@#$ $#@ REMOVE HUEY #$%
@#$ $#@ I want another Metal Gear where REX is on your side. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fight in 4 was so fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really wish DWalker had a REX skin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there any REX figures that aren't too expensive that you don't need to assemble? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not by itself, but the metallic archaea would've turned it into one gigantic walking nuke if I remember right #$%
@#$ $#@ Get back on your boat. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fight literally had a time limit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow Moses REX was just more awesome than all of its imitators. #$%
@#$ $#@ The head is armored. #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes up like half of its health bar, that's why it's a bonus objective. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let go. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you talking about, its a dog! #$%
@#$ $#@ A DOG! #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill concede that basing Sahelanthropus off of REX for fanservice was probably a dumb thing all together, but then the greater sin was literally having that whole thing be cutscene-only to nostalgia fuck with us for less than the sum of five minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ nothing, its not very effective. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kaz radios something about it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes like 50 shots, apparently random, to stun him and Miller actually has a unique comment for it supposedly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or you can ram a jeep in his face off a nearby cliff. #$%
@#$ $#@ If there ever was a fuck up, this is it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stupid motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ the part with the fucking fire #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah what part with the fire #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a fire alarm, it's a text to voice program from his stream chat. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its saying behind or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ My god thats a great webm. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is gonna be a classic in a couple years, I can tell. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean the yukkuri voice thing? #$%
@#$ $#@ i lold. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who the hell is this guy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is he dead or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a lightly audible alarm though, it playes after the fire is already lit up to hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ No he got out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some other anon said someone else in his apartment complex died though. #$%
@#$ $#@ at 6:40 what does the cute alarm girl say? #$%
@#$ $#@ Try watching the video with your audio turned on. #$%
@#$ $#@ woop woop click-click-click click-click-click #$%
@#$ $#@ What did the voice say right at the 11:32 mark? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, thats wrong I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was another fire that they were mistaking it with where someone died, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ nigguh its not an alarm its a fucking text to voice from his stream #$%
@#$ $#@ People on the stream are yelling at him to look behind him and get a fire extinguisher #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like grainy, low quality canned audio from a cheap alarm. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea what its saying or how it would be considered seductive. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean the sound that plays constantly between each "woop woop"? #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt even sound like a voice, just a noise. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can slightly here the ending something-desu its really cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want something like that for an alarm. #$%
@#$ $#@ He also doused it in lighter fluid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because after he freaks out over his spilling oil over that thing he's using the "match" is still on fire while his other hand is using the liquid container, and what better thing than to put a small fire inside a plastic bag full of paper while you're surrounded by cardboard boxes which were probably empty #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its saying kaji desu! #$%
@#$ $#@ kaji desu! #$%
@#$ $#@ which means there's a fire, there's a fire #$%
@#$ $#@ This tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes really that not much different from Burch tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah I wouldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just about every year my primary school would send us off to some fire safety exercise at a firefighter station. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were really practical and helpful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking CUTE #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the worst part about this is that there are at least two people in the apartment that are trying to put out the fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ They both leave the room to go fill up cups of water and slowly walk around all the flammable shit to slightly douse the fire without even considering maybe one of them should smother it and move the fucking mounds of garbage away from the fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention all the times he adds to the fire by fanning it with cardboard and then leaving it there. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont feel an ounce of sympathy for these idiots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you saying non-autists dont light cigarettes indoors? #$%
@#$ $#@ tbh I'd rather be Anthony Burch than that guy #$%
@#$ $#@ You know I have a fire extinguisher in my house but Ive never used one in my life. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know you just pull the ring pin out, aim the nozzle at the fire from a short distance and press the handle down but having never practiced with one I am still fearful that I might not do it properly. #$%
@#$ $#@ That shit is the finest fire safety video Ive ever seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing like seeing a fire that killed a hundred people from start to finish to understand why theres all these rules and regulations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive had my fair share of kitchen fires, one or two bigger than I care to admit and I knew what to do immediately to put them out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont panic, use your head and put out the damn fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ With kitchen fires in particular you gotta be careful not to use water but to smother it. #$%
@#$ $#@ This dude is treating a fucking fire like its a misbehaving dog or grumpy child. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your glass of water. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go away now, thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would have taken the fucking trash can into the shower #$%
@#$ $#@ Totally not a fire hazard at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a fucking disgusting room. #$%
@#$ $#@ just make sure its not expired. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you going to use the op as an instructional? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fire might be a better alternative to that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt look like a trash can though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt it just a plastic bag and it falls apart from the fire as he moves it? #$%
@#$ $#@ It may be obvious, but some advice should you ever need it: aim at the base of the fire, not the fire itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it's just a bag, the guy doesn't even have a trash bin. #$%
@#$ $#@ It breaks apart when hes carrying it anyway, I doubt he could have taken it to the bathroom. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's in the green area, so I'm good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Out in the country son, I have to light fires to survive in the winter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I get reckless. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Im better at putting out uncontained fires than starting contained fires at this point, so shove it city boy. #$%
@#$ $#@ it means fire #$%
@#$ $#@ At least her used a fire extinguisher... #$%
@#$ $#@ right next to a burning fucking gas pump... #$%
@#$ $#@ and tuesday apparantly #$%
@#$ $#@ Bravo Burgerland #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt be smoking cigarettes in the first place, so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a permanent match. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think its used for outdoors shit though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Burning this house down. #$%
@#$ $#@ With no weeb survivors. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was all a master plan to kill a neighbor he hated by making it look like he was too retarded to put out a fire #$%
@#$ $#@ rip in peace #$%
@#$ $#@ He was fanning it with the blanket which oxidized the fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ He should have tried smothering and possible pouring water on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fucking box probably would have been enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ The blanked definitely would have, especially if he had poured the water on it first. #$%
@#$ $#@ But retard boy left both as kindling instead of finishing the job. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is why I'm glad I'm in a new building with sprinklers fucking everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, it'll suck that all my shit will be wet and ruined, but I won't die. #$%
@#$ $#@ probably Bouyomi-chan #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even think my smoke alarm is working. #$%
@#$ $#@ I burned some shit on the stove a few days ago and nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ As if his parents weren't deeply ashamed enough due to the fact that their 40 year old son was a livestreamer, he has to go and do this #$%
@#$ $#@ Well whats stopping you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like my apartment, and if sprinklers kick in the place will need to be gutted #$%
@#$ $#@ It's Japan though, it's not uncommon for families to live together. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuff like this always reminds me no matter how pathetic your life may seem, someone else is far worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you fucking kidding me? #$%
@#$ $#@ You gamergators are still trying to force this retarded meme here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's going to keep coming and it's already likely spread inside of your walls #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, hes a fucking dumbass, but I was just saying living with your family as an adult isnt always met with the wow, thats pathetic attitude it is in the US, particularly in cultures where families are closer and stay together. #$%
@#$ $#@ because you cant put out electrical fire with those. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure that means its in the walls and there's not much you can do to stop that without the fire brigade #$%
@#$ $#@ Because youre not a fire fighter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah his lackluster behavior with the fucking cigarette is enough to spell trouble. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Anthony. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do britbongs seriously call gas, petrol? #$%
@#$ $#@ What the FUCK is wrong with you people? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would because I was taught fire safety, I'd just run to the tap that's like 10 steps from my room and soak a towel and put the fire out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure most civilised places that have brick walls have a gap inside the walls #$%
@#$ $#@ The inside of your house is all brick? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't play with fire in the first place, so I won't get into that situation #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill never stream Minecraft. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder how much otaku shit he lost. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a hell of a lot of manga or anything in the shot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say he has more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either way, Id wager his neet collection is garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Garbage like his soul. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think a bomb shelter would save you. #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as you grab your tower and external hard drives as you make your way out you can be back to lording it over the normalfags before the day is over. #$%
@#$ $#@ not very because insurance is pretty cool about fires and also because i don't value any of my possessions #$%
@#$ $#@ I love my PC, but since shits old and everything is on Steam anyways Id grab my cheap bass and try to take my 11 kg digital piano with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ the stuff I care about can easily be replaced #$%
@#$ $#@ parents boughtg all my stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ wont care so i would just get newer versions of what i had #$%
@#$ $#@ Most Asians are dumb, its just that they only let you see the smart ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ you live in a shithole neighborhood? #$%
@#$ $#@ That station one, damn dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ From now on, Ill keep note of at least the fire exits every time I go to a building. #$%
@#$ $#@ Newfag redditor bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny thing is, he couldve just dropped the bag in one of those empty boxes, taken it to a sink/tub and just doused it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or he couldve used that blanket to just smother it. #$%
@#$ $#@ A wet towel wouldve worked too. #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy had no concept of how fire works. #$%
@#$ $#@ He literally fans the flames higher and adds more fuel to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The light stomping with the cardboard box is especially retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ The one kitchen fire I ever had, I just took a fire extinguisher to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ these idiots are far worse, tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ The exits were blocked. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck did that even happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ bitch please, i keep a 13lb bag of baking soda in my closet for cleaning and i know to cover a small fire instead of aggravate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ that fucking retarded cock sucker had plenty of time to control the fire but instead he fanned it and took like 60 seconds to grab a small bowl of water #$%
@#$ $#@ You can set it up actually, some small streams use it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hooks through IRC. #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem is Twitch viewers are mentally 8 and think making it spam is funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ shut the fuck up dude before i call the cops #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but Ill at least keep note of the fire exits. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I see a possible fire starting, Im bolting straight to the exit rather than wondering where the exit is. #$%
@#$ $#@ It might save me some precious time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think this is the map to keep things in perspective. #$%
@#$ $#@ You need to be trained not to play with fire? #$%
@#$ $#@ For starters, I wouldnt try putting out a fire by putting fucking cardboard boxes on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, pick one up next time you go to a big box store of whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ they are pretty cheap. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have two in my house. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is how you handle a fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad there's at least one smart dude on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ underrated post tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ just like my movies #$%
@#$ $#@ He actually costed someones life. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think you get how panic and mobs work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Using a blanket to smother a fire can be good if youre not dumb and let it catch on fire or just fan the flames with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a different fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ *tips fedora* #$%
@#$ $#@ most anons actually believe using fabric would have worked too. #$%
@#$ $#@ You really want to be smarter but most people there with "she should have done XXX" are just as ignorant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you trying to say a heavy blanket i.e futon wouldnt have smothered that fire? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre going to extract him? #$%
@#$ $#@ You cover the blanket on the fire then stomp on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ He didnt want to the stream to hear him asking for help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that anon, but I laughed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a meme #$%
@#$ $#@ He literally used one carboard box just to fan the flames, then left the cardboard box on top of the fire and ran out, then he used the blanket to fan the flames some more, and let it catch fire then threw it to the side after it was lit.. #$%
@#$ $#@ Assuming this is true, wouldn't work for me since I'm a hairy mother fucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fire would just start spreading on to me instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ body hair doesn't catch on fire it instantly burns and you would't be getting burned by the fire since it will be instantly killed by the lack of oxygen, it would just be hot as hell since the floor or debris is heated tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ hes deserves a bullet in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ alot of the blame of the fire is on him and he still refuses to take any responsibility #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice manufactured home walls anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Welcome to cheap housing in the midwest mate #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, Im impressed /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ctrl + Fd asian expecting 10+ results about how the entire asian race is retarded because of this 1 guy, but instead I only found 2 posts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is 4chan becoming SJW now? #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck is it his fault? #$%
@#$ $#@ hi /pol/ #$%
@#$ $#@ all I see there is cheap wood coated in highly flammable plastic. #$%
@#$ $#@ if a match were to fall there, youd have less than half the time that jap had to get outside. #$%
@#$ $#@ your floor is like a giant barbecue fire starter. #$%
@#$ $#@ My room's messy as fuck and I'd still know not to throw fucking cardboard and paper over a fire. #$%
@#$ $#@ My Asian instincts tell me to quickly spray the fire with air freshener, as fire only spreads in impure air. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably a futon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not those shitty folding couches, but a super thick blanket used in place of a mattress. #$%
@#$ $#@ but why would you do that #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if you're retarded or just trolling AND retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did he ded? #$%
@#$ $#@ As my father told me, 'Son, them there be called flamables becase they be made by dem homo ape fucker liberuls.' #$%
@#$ $#@ Shows what you know nerd. #$%
@#$ $#@ I refuse to believe someone intentionally did this #$%
@#$ $#@ It only went to shit because he kept fucking up #$%
@#$ $#@ I just hope that was his own house, not some rental flat. #$%
@#$ $#@ He needs to suffer. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Im talking about The Station video and that soccer stadium. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Station was completely up in flames within around four minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ whos this semen demon? #$%
@#$ $#@ the one that is losing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, that venue fire was a big deal back when it happened because it highlighted fire safety protocols and pyrotechnics. #$%
@#$ $#@ IIRC that venue was occupied over the fire safety limit not sure if youre American but a lot of establishments have a Fire Marshall posting about how many people can be in the building at once, especially if the building is primarily just 1 large room. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure it was an apartment and some old lady on the floor above died because of him. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was not and no one died. #$%
@#$ $#@ There wasn't just a shitton of people, there were almost no exits except for the big front doors and the pyrotechnics were in violation of some law where you can't light fireworks inside. #$%
@#$ $#@ Add that to a loose spark fountain that was next to an exposed wooden stud and it was over #$%
@#$ $#@ So what was this guy doing, just streaming himself playing with matches and shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ just take it anywhere with tile. #$%
@#$ $#@ your kitchen, the bathroom, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you blabbering about? #$%
@#$ $#@ That has to suck... #$%
@#$ $#@ 1 minute youre hailing satan doing the sign of the devil and looking cool in front of your girlfriend hoping youll get laid that night, the next youre literally in a burning hell! #$%
@#$ $#@ is it american way to life in cardbox? #$%
@#$ $#@ And in the middle of a desert #$%
@#$ $#@ do we start the fire? #$%
@#$ $#@ These are touching. #$%

@#$ $#@ Well you see, The American way of life, or simply the American way, is the unique lifestyle, real or imagined, of the people living in the United States of America. #$%
@#$ $#@ It refers to a nationalist ethos that purports to adhere to principles of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." #$%
@#$ $#@ At the center of the American way is the American Dream, the idea that upward mobility is achievable by any American through hard work. #$%
@#$ $#@ This concept is intertwined with the concept of American exceptionalism, the notion that the American way is only possible in the U.S. #$%
@#$ $#@ because of the unique culture of the nation.This way of life, which developed from the 17th century onward, is an example of a behavioral modality, a set of behavioral norms which develops in..... #$%

@#$ $#@ What did you expect from Putin daughter #$%
@#$ $#@ I knew it couldnt happen, but I really wanted the final boss of Dark Souls II to be an insanely strong version of your Chosen Undead from Dark Souls with special attacks based on whether it was a strength, dex, magic, or faith build and using your armor and weapon. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fucking doujin, she deserves better ;-; #$%
@#$ $#@ Dantes Inferno? #$%

@#$ $#@ I think lost planet did this. #$%
@#$ $#@ He punched the kid, broke his nose, and continued to punch him. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was the aggressor and his life as well as someone elses was not in danger. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt self defense. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bully wasnt about to kill him. #$%
@#$ $#@ His life wasnt in danger even if he was mentally unstable. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything the bully was in more danger than him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Danger created by the bully himself. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything, the guy could become a victim again if he critically injured the bully. #$%
@#$ $#@ He couldve, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ But self defense is a judged by that particular instance. #$%
@#$ $#@ You would have so many insane cases if you argue potential future events. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bully likely deserved what he got but if the boy had pressed charges Anon wouldve been fucked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats that one where the boyfriend teases/insults his meek girlfriend so much she just sorta snaps and goes completely S on him in bed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do niggers take screencaps of screencaps? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does /v/ repost this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's chivalry in making a bully aware of who he's beating up #$%
@#$ $#@ so....what does that card do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its got a activation condition, but does nothing on resolution? #$%
@#$ $#@ I must know what this is from. #$%
@#$ $#@ It removes the nigga from the field. #$%
@#$ $#@ If only this were a real card. #$%
@#$ $#@ My LGS is full of niggers, part of the reason I transitioned to MTG. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just activates, it has no action. #$%
@#$ $#@ If this was in those GBA YGO games, this would be the perfect bait to get the AI to use up their Seven Tools/Solemn cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK YOU, HOW IS THIS SHIT GETTING MENTIONED AND NOT MOTHER 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ sauce boss #$%
@#$ $#@ Digimon World 4 has this. #$%
@#$ $#@ You beat Mecha Rogue 05 and suddenly theyre everywhere after the first fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tits are too big #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you some kind of homo? #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you expecting a girl in a kemono doujin to have small tits? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Kemonono. #$%
@#$ $#@ He should stop drawing furry shit and get back to MILFs on tight jeans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kemonono is like the poor mans Hiroyuki, even Secret Plot is better than that stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ furries are into extreme proportions #$%
@#$ $#@ this man speaks on behalf of all scaleys #$%
@#$ $#@ Which Hiroyuki? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Im seeing some real QUALITY stuff here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, thats better. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Im not really concerned about anatomy on my anatomically impossible MILFs. #$%
@#$ $#@ You asked me. #$%
@#$ $#@ which one is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im having trouble with panda. #$%
@#$ $#@ The way I see it, her being a beast race is the best way for the comic to work. #$%
@#$ $#@ The boy being literally raised by wolves actually makes it a little more interesting #$%
@#$ $#@ what is this from, are the butts really all that juicy? #$%
@#$ $#@ be dat sauce b0ss #$%
@#$ $#@ i like your version anon, it soothes my soul #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy X and X-2 tend to do a lot of this #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you kind fellow #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont really see things either. #$%
@#$ $#@ You only see the light reflecting off those things. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was hard as shit, then I realized you need to do a little bit of grinding. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not much, but you probably need one or two more health upgrades. #$%
@#$ $#@ It turns it from nightmare modo to easy as piss. #$%
@#$ $#@ what game #$%
@#$ $#@ i fuckin love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best way to feel your progression and improvement of your character #$%
@#$ $#@ eat my ass nerd #$%
@#$ $#@ Whered you get this picture, son? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sins face in FFX? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never tried doing it without Anima #$%
@#$ $#@ Gears of War #$%
@#$ $#@ Poju, one of his earlier works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty good considering theres no gay shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah if you don't haste your party, and have break damage limit, that fucking fight is stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Finally, a time to post this #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent seen much futa in the past like 4 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ minimal gay shit, shame though, I like pojus art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes everyone look soft and supple. #$%
@#$ $#@ I NEED this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent known how to check circulations or that japanese share site since forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try Dokurosan, only scat I could ever tolerate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mama Tama #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing more hilarious about this edit is that some Jap was just plain buttangry about FFXIII to the point where he made that page in the first place #$%
@#$ $#@ Is 2nd row, far right Odanon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Impressive, that looks nothing like his usual work. #$%
@#$ $#@ FOR YOU #$%
@#$ $#@ what game? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want a sequel to War of the Monsters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for a new Metroid. #$%
@#$ $#@ The roster is exclusively fursonas from the development team. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats looks /m/ as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I need this. #$%
@#$ $#@ With nothing to cater to retards with, combined with the fact that everybody on PC pirates, developers realize there's no point in developing games at all anymore because it's only a venture that will lose money, so the industry dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Indies will stick around for a little bit, but theyre all of incredibly poor quality. #$%
@#$ $#@ This might be a problem though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing happens. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also your balls get ripped off before you slowly breath to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wish for infinite wishes that have no bad side effects #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted,you forget about your favorite vidya and everything else in your life due to a serious concussion causing brain damage and amnesia. #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesn't follow the theme and function at all #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes it does, read the OP #$%
@#$ $#@ The balls thing is completely unrelated to the wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just happens on its own. #$%
@#$ $#@ No JP voices, only a terrible dub #$%
@#$ $#@ Your wish is granted, but you are rendered mute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Congrats, you now have infinite wishes with no side effects, each wishes now costs 5 billion of dollars, and 100 human beings burned as a offering to the gods, as a side effect of this first wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, now he sleep forever #$%
@#$ $#@ His identical clone, Exodus is shoehorned in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but the game is still created as if he were present, he just never is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plotlines and references are brought up that are ultimately connected to what amounts to the equivalent of cut content. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like you #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but all other genres of games become significantly worse, to the point where open world games are the only contenders for GOTY #$%
@#$ $#@ So basically Colossal Kaiju Combat? #$%
@#$ $#@ It got made but Konami see it as a failure and never will have the audiences so it get shelved, forever #$%
@#$ $#@ living a life where you die naturally along with the rest of the horrible things op mentioned #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard and I don’t want any zombie turkeys, I don’t want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don’t want any other weird surprises. #$%
@#$ $#@ You got it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The turkeys a little dry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, the turkey is unpleasantly dry. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy fucking shit dude ryebread is the best fucking thing ever #$%
@#$ $#@ The lettuce isnt crispy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The monkey comes back as a zombie, and it spreads the infection to other zombies, which spreads to other monkeys, and so on, eventually infecting all non-human creatures the world over. #$%
@#$ $#@ OH FOUL ACCURSED THING, WHAT DEMON FROM THE DEPTHS OF HELL CREATED THEE? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish that Smashfags would stop bitching about fighting games being too hard to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every dev in the industry decides they want the Smash Bros audience and now every fighting game plays like a floaty platformer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, its an FPS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, it's a mobile game with a cash shop #$%
@#$ $#@ But everybody shits on it because Sonic 06 and Sonic Boom were bad so this one is probably bad too. #$%
@#$ $#@ forged in darkness from wheat harvested in Hells half-acre, baked by Beelzebub, slathered with mayonnaise from the evil eggs of a powerful dark chicken, beaten into sauce by the hands of a one-eyed madman, [with] cheese boiled from the rancid teat of a three-headed fanged cow [and] layered with 666 separate meats from an animal which has maggots for blood. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also has lettuce and Dijon mustard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a cute girl with a vagina. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve got a big dick n ball strap-on, but its not as good as the real thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but you've got extreme erectile dysfunction #$%
@#$ $#@ You asked for a big dick n balls. #$%
@#$ $#@ You got what you wanted. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has the worst writing in the series and basically ruins everyone characters with its edgy demeanor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Essentially become the worst of the series and no chance of a sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ When you stop being a retarded teenager you will realize your fetish is garbage and you lucked out. #$%
@#$ $#@ It succeeds in Huehueland. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your wish has been granted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but you don't have a scrotum #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish videogames were never invented. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but they cant find theirs #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but all wait times are increased by 1000% and there is no buddy system. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will never have time to play all of the ones you want and will live in agony of your failed dreams. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy your debt. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for the Assassin Creed series to not be shitty. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it was because they wouldnt think anything bad would actually happen, so they just did a throwaway wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make a movie of this #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for coyote and cheese sandwich. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish to make a crowd funded space sim and revive the space-sim industry through my personal direction #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted,your waifu lives a long,healthy life but you die immediately after meeting her. #$%
@#$ $#@ that already exists #$%
@#$ $#@ *For The Old Republic not to exist #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted,you're in a horrible accident the day it comes out and you lose both of your hands so you can't play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 10/10 for the teenage playtesters, not for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Done, Capcom farms it out to some Western dev and they turn it into a generic WRPG with terrible combat, with a further twist being that for some reason, youre able to visit the alternate reality of Earth in the game, and it becomes a FPS from there. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have to fund it through Kickstarter and its eventual release is 100x smaller and less detailed than promised. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is completed, but due to legal reasons is never released. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one manages to leak it either. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait a minute that's basically what happened #$%
@#$ $#@ It turns out their vision was shit and everything good was in P.T. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kickstarter dies, a more jewish website replaces it and is way worse at enforcing consumer laws. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for HD .hack re-release #$%
@#$ $#@ Time to go penguin hunting then #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, but you can never get a console or a cpu to play them. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's no monkey paw, it's a rainy devil! #$%
@#$ $#@ Well fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess we'll have to keep doing it the slow way with global warming #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo goes bankrupt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck I played this so much as a kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Motherfucking preytor was the shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but he can never get restful sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is, just not for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even the Monkey Paw is that sadistic, Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your age stays 22 but your body isnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're attractive to 80 years old people #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted; you get all the punishments, but their wishes are granted on a different planet. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the wish is related to them physically they get transported to said planet with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is no oxygen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, but youre deported to any Muslim country. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have no genitals or capacity for love, however, and your appearance takes constant maintainence. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre all mobile games in the style of Clash of Clans or Fallout Shelter, with micro transactions. #$%
@#$ $#@ So Im The Major? #$%
@#$ $#@ The next early access release is a 10/10. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is then dropped by the dev who is headhunted up by Bioware to work on Trans Simulator 201x #$%
@#$ $#@ Sucks for you I literally just finished it an hour ago! #$%
@#$ $#@ Lost Levels or Doki Doki Panic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, its the Mario 2 that the USA got. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh fuck i didn't mention the version #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted with no negatives because even the Monkey Paw like Ace Combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fine by me #$%
@#$ $#@ Its now Open World flight sim in sense of Ubisoft games where you activate towers, do repetitive missions, and auto-play mechanic like AH. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its better than 4,5, and 0, from the Metacritic scores perspective. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want a 3D remake of Pong for the Occulus Rift. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the physics are off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, actually, I cant think of a negative twist for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Due to the fact that the world is now more productive the world dies sooner?? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's no video games, only be replaced by Interactive Visual Entertainment #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, he takes all your money forever, you have no money to buy video games anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted but they only go for Chads #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, nothing else changes they're still 2d just living, eventually riots break out over who has the best waifu resulting in the world blowing up #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, were still too beta to get them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt it already? #$%
@#$ $#@ What with all the sjw crap #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, your futa gf has several STDs, and her favorite game is a MOBA. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted but she has absolute shit taste in vidya, to the point it gives you migraines. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also her dick is tiny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her penis won't pleasure you in any way and she rarely has time to play vidya with you #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but the story is shit, and the protags are written as edgy, whiny, hypocritical teen Mary Sues so infuriatingly unlikable that even the terribly written 1-dimensional villains seem better. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to deal with social interaction ith your squadron mates, styled after Mass Effect. #$%
@#$ $#@ The final mission has the greatest gameplay in video games, but everybody stopped playing because the characters and story are so bad theyre acknowledged by the entire world, including the State of Israel, to be worse than the Holocaust. #$%
@#$ $#@ granted, its made by current konami #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, they only appear in shops and the prices are outrageous, also the shopkeepers are invincible and quicker than you #$%
@#$ $#@ If you try to tell anybody about your playthroughs, they will rightfully accuse you of cheating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youll spend the rest of your life wondering if you could have won legit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted /v/ becomes elitist for consoles and handheld and refuses to acknowledge good gsmes for pc #$%
@#$ $#@ It now has TPS controls and the stun rod is now a machine gun. #$%
@#$ $#@ The art style and humor is still there but the platforming is toned down significantly. #$%
@#$ $#@ sauce on the anime girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Id wish for all the weeaboo gamer fags to die from AIDS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not just give it to me, neighborino? #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead of games changing, you change. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same end result but you feel as though you shouldnt enjoy jacking off to ragdoll physics and getting out-of-bounds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, you never find it, but you keep searching and searching...someone eventually finds your corpse #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, video games are dead cause the biggest market for them died from AIDS. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont understand this meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish my waifu could talk with me and she also loved me back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but without weeaboos the market is forever flooded with chest-high wall shooters. #$%
@#$ $#@ You become a /mu/tant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you stuck on either Reddit, SA, or GameFAQS #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, you have more time for video games, your life is still in shambles #$%
@#$ $#@ You're an autistic redditor now #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUU #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that all anyone wants? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, it's 20 minutes demo sold on $40 #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, GZ was a 15 minute demo and it turned out better than TPP, so i guess i win. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck man #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted. #$%
@#$ $#@ You also swapped genders. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks monkey paw! #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna go show off my tits onine and rake in the cash #$%
@#$ $#@ A good class based RPG for the 3DS, that is reasonably priced, fully functional and well balanced, with no bullshit dlc and has great music, story, and gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ And a good world and dungeons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, nothing else happens because monkeypaw would like this as well #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, all the cash you get is in an outdated currency. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but it won't ship until 2025 and won't be localized #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you got mobile pager gaming #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, their dicks are practically non existant and they only ever want to play single player games, shitty ones at that #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, the black van will visit you shortly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek it's snake on Nokia all over again #$%
@#$ $#@ The harem does not really love you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Within a couple of days they collude. #$%
@#$ $#@ In a matter of weeks you are found dead, and the harem escapes with money stolen from you. #$%
@#$ $#@ EVERYTIME I POST IT BECOMES A MEME #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, reddit tumblr and 9gag absolutely loves them and 4chan knows you created them so your permabanned #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, they love you so much that they get into video games themselves, but sadly theit favorite games are the ones you hate, you will never stop hearing about how great they are for the rest of your life #$%
@#$ $#@ You become Burch, and even worse, Borderlands didn't sold 13 millions so Burch really really don't have any influences in video games #$%
@#$ $#@ Knew I shoulda made it airtight, but I got curious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, a similar thread will return tomorrow night so you wont get any sleep then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre all yandere and fight to the death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but seeing as you found the Monkey Paw here, a time paradox occurs destroying the rest of time and space. #$%
@#$ $#@ The monkey knows what I want, so I believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to keep it. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ dissappears, everyone wonders what happened so a new one is created #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool, Ill wish for the same wish there then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, its moved to The Escapist forums. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Monkey Paw slaps you for being such a fucking faggot about your wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ You made a good wish, but it gets corrupted. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're obsessed with feasting over your dick and devour it leaving you dick-less and bleeding to death #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, hell get off the boat in the next chapter,however hell get back on the boat back to the mainland and itll take double the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's vegan halal #$%
@#$ $#@ A buck saddles up and starts fucking your mouth with his limp dick, but it swells up to its full side breaking your jaw and neck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish granted, $25 per memory, goyim. #$%
@#$ $#@ And MMOs are a twist in themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like an old PC your brain isnt advanced enough to run it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You become an autistic tripfag named Vaporeon. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bunch of ugly, crossdressing chicken farmers raising very large GMO chickens lock you up in a cellar and rape you with their small, wrinkled penises. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have an old gameboy which helps you forget, but the batteries will run out soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ You got it, you can make infinite wishes with no bad side effects but have no monkeys paw to make them on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted but Miura and his assistants die after releasing the chapter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but your has been recently prostate removed. #$%
@#$ $#@ just let kojima remain at the helm of metal gear, please #$%
@#$ $#@ You get it, but all your non-vidya essential belongings get stolen, repeatedly #$%
@#$ $#@ I KNOW, NIGGA. #$%
@#$ $#@ Goddamn, I need to go to bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish for a hammer and every copy of Earthbound in existence. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but you are too weak to use said hammer, and nobody will satisfy your insane and spiteful wish. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish to be witnessed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your wish is granted, you have all the time you will ever need to stop playing vidya #$%
@#$ $#@ You get one, but he has a small dick, is very bad at fucking, doesnt actually like it and prefers getting off by humping your pillow and then gets cancer and dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ After that you cant think of bestiality without remembering your friend, which kills all your horniness. #$%
@#$ $#@ A volcano. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but when you finally think of your greatest desire, the thread will have been archived and the opportunity lost forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'M THE LAW I'M THE LAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW~ #$%
@#$ $#@ Source?Cannot find shit #$%
@#$ $#@ You get all the copies of Earthbound in existence copied on your hard drive. #$%
@#$ $#@ granted, but none of the wishes come true, you merely have infinite ideas for wishes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anarchy reigns gets a politically correct release and lively tumblr community focused on rule 34 of the characters, with fetishes you hate. #$%
@#$ $#@ You enjoy only a tiny part of the community and only barely so, which keeps you from leaving for anything better and actually makes you miserable when you keep getting banned for triggering someone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Done, but it has no modding of any kind, this includes the map editor, and you can only queue into games with random people. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want an HD remake of the mother trilogy #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn it... #$%
@#$ $#@ Moga is burnt down after the first mission. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish the poor monkey can have its hand back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Done,but it gets destroyed when you hit high rank and you're forced to live in the deserted island #$%
@#$ $#@ Done, but its an ungrateful little bitch and flings some shit at you with the new hand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted, but your fapping hand falls off and becomes a monkey paw #$%
@#$ $#@ The monkey paw strikes again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just give me another image so i can reverse search it for fucks sake man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Done, but theres not enough women. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make a movie about of transforming into a diaper werewolf. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man Powered Up 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I just fucking want more Mega Man Legends games man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ya pretty much throw in something like Persona social links to the game were you can date and fuck the megaman girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would sell, but at what cost. #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw what waifushit did to Fire Emblem. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt wish that on another old series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better to just die with some kind of dignity. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is that worse than Lyn constantly fellating the selfinsert tactician? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think maybe he was supposed to be cleverly arguing that mega man actually is relevant for today #$%
@#$ $#@ the player tactician becomes completely disregarded after the first 10 chapters and Lyn becomes a side character, as opposed to the game revolving around the self insert and a major plot point being who marries who #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as they didnt really the personalities of Mega Man, Roll, and the Bonnes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus the plot points on carbons, the hunters and such, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id gamble on that. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it was too different then there wouldnt be much of a point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man Legends sold itself on the characters and story rather than gameplay, though I really enjoyed that too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think its popular, but its not really a blunder console. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo makes a modest profit off of it now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make him more naked and sexualized. #$%
@#$ $#@ The one they used makes more sense and was more interesting, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ It represented much better the first 5-6 games on the NES when the series was in its prime. #$%
@#$ $#@ Going with OPs render would basically be focusing on MM7-8. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes dead when they get there. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know this would work because of FE and I would be ok with it if it brought back Megaman. #$%
@#$ $#@ No more megaman. #$%
@#$ $#@ now hx is megamxn, a transgender robot created to fight the opression of the MANvericks, created by the racist and appropiatelly named Dr. #$%
@#$ $#@ also, he cant be blue because that is a gendered color. #$%
@#$ $#@ he has to be fucsia or purple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why didnt they do the same with Sonic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sega wanted them to and Capcom doesnt give a fuck what they did with Mega? #$%
@#$ $#@ But is it worth the inevitable negative reception? #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, Capcom has been releasing some kind of port/compilations of old Mega Man games for the last four generations. #$%
@#$ $#@ While Mega Man Legacy Collection may have good sales, people viewed it as no more than a quick cash-grab, and quite a lazy one, comparing it unfavorably to compilations released nearly a decade ago #$%
@#$ $#@ The Legacy collection collected a lot of flack for being a less inclusive game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure people would bitch about the asset colors and whatnot; but if 34 Mega Man games were playable on it; they couldn't complain Capcom scrimped on the game content. #$%
@#$ $#@ Serious question, how much do you think people would pay for such a collection vs how much Capcom would actually want to charge for it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sidescrolling Action RPG with art by George Kamitani and a parts replacement/upgrade system #$%
@#$ $#@ Have him be in a Minecraft like game where he makes epic reaction faces #$%
@#$ $#@ Let be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like megaman, especially X series up to X6. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I dont really care if it never came back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Legend is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ X-series is where it at. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the better options they could do would be just starting a new sub-series. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'd still be Mega Man, but they'd have a lot more freedom in what to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it works, then yeah maybe they could properly make Legends 3 and show they give a fuck about older MM series and the fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ How DARE you call yourself a megaman fan if you dont want yearly megaman games again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well that IS how Mega Man has historically tried new ideas. #$%
@#$ $#@ You take the Megaman Deathmatch, and you make it into a online TPS/FPS game with matchmaking and an updated graphics since lets be honest no one would get hype over a doom.wad game in modern day vidya. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man Maker is honestly the best choice for making Mega Man relevant again, it would be so much better than Mario Maker which is a great game. #$%
@#$ $#@ huh, thats actually a really fair assertion. #$%
@#$ $#@ ive still held off on purchasing a wiiu mainly cause my friend has one and can bring it over to play sm4sh and stuff #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be good for sure but probably too easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because X is designed around jumping and shooting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how you aim. #$%
@#$ $#@ What about something like Awesomenauts, but with Robot Masters? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres technical reasons, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Resident Evil 5 was already silky smooth singleplayer, but add a second player and it becomes a slideshow. #$%
@#$ $#@ But as I suggested, I reckon this is Sony and MS way to sell more consoles, the pubs just agree to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sony and MS have WAY more push and sway that you like to admit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tweak the game play and presentation, something to make it stand out more as something other than retro, but not too edgy. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can start by not using the literal skinsuit version of him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keeping the 2D alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't fucking care what it's on at this point, just let me play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megaman X is objectively better than classic megaman #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats post-game armor you get by playing the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rock should start as the half-naked robot boy in the beginning but as you gain more skills and fight you become Megaman over the course of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not Rock. #$%
@#$ $#@ putting him on Smash bros was a good start. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hire this man, Capcom. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats hella expensive if you still want them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dropped way too much to get Vile. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would like to see a reboot of sorts that takes you from Rock to Mega to X to Battle Network all in one game. #$%
@#$ $#@ mml3 or actually make a mega man game #$%
@#$ $#@ Zero is better than that pacifist pussy X #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesn't need to end m8 just tie up the fucking Wily story already #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh god, I'm sorry I'm ignoring your post, but I would kill for another Battle and Chase game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im the only person I know who has ever played and liked B&amp;C. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, I once thought they could make a new sub-series during or just a bit after the Legends timeline. #$%
@#$ $#@ This could be a potential good compromise and a way to apologize for the Legends 3 fiasco. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont know how other Legends fans would feel about it, but at least we would get Trigger out of the moon and a real Legends 3 could be done explaining things later. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to bed, Vile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres like millions of years gap between Zero or ZX whatever and Legends. #$%
@#$ $#@ well issue with B&amp;C is that Sony prevented it from releasing in the west for whatever fucking reason, even though Capcom was all ready and rarin to go. #$%
@#$ $#@ supposedly they even ran a few ads for it #$%
@#$ $#@ Capcom should make game where Megaman gets killed by Zero #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, what was the best car in this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never played this with anyone outside my family but I think it was the standard Mega Man or Bass car because you could shoot the fuck out of everything and drown your opponent in items. #$%
@#$ $#@ The second best might be the Rolls car. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it even in the same timeline? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres an old publication that places Legends at the far end of the timeline started by Classic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Napalm Man has great parts, but his car and its weapons are pretty lackluster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Duo is ludicrously broken, but hes kind of a pain to unlock. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes; pre-release documents show that to be the case. #$%
@#$ $#@ people assumed that was the case since that Master said stuff about resetting the world #$%
@#$ $#@ No less than 4,000 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ And no telling how many more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its easier to cope with when you realize Rock worked as Dr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Light's assistant when he wasn't fucking up Robot Masters, so he had a direct hand in making X. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was also later confirmed by a surprisingly detailed summary of the connection between Classic/X that was posted around the time the Zero Collection came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ I betcha he kept Roll around after turning Rock into beer cans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well the world flooded and humanity was both extinct and replaced with artificial copies, so itd take a lot more time than a few thousand years for that to be believable. #$%
@#$ $#@ That wasnt really detailed on the Classic to X part. #$%
@#$ $#@ In fact it retconned the OCW on what the Virus actually was, and at this point who cares? #$%
@#$ $#@ Be more like his little brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a cute and colorful shooter where you can customize your squid kid and it's not the same as other FPS where the goal is to put bullets in everyone in the 15 second intervals you have before you die again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically because its fun and refreshing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I suck at using Wilys, because his turning is so bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a big fan of his weapons either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a group of faggots and the group is called Man of Action, which is confusing. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yeah theyre doing a cartoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ And there's a live action movie that's unrelated. #$%
@#$ $#@ I seriously doubt replouids can reproduce sexually, I dont think they are even able to age and have to get their lifespan constantly checked and get upgrades. #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes practice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember dislking his shield because it's only useful if you're getting hit from behind. #$%
@#$ $#@ The ZOCW isnt fanart sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder that Zero got his ass whipped by X. #$%
@#$ $#@ I skipped Clown Man because I figured Circus Man would be a close enough match #$%
@#$ $#@ Vile, not X. #$%
@#$ $#@ You seem spiteful #$%
@#$ $#@ remember that they actually were doing that and cancelled it for no reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would love a Mega Man game like Mario 3D World. #$%
@#$ $#@ Add a combat system similar to the 3D Zeldas just with shooting, and it would be GOAT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well they are original sprites though. #$%
@#$ $#@ They arent copy-pased from any of the other games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might have been necessary since MMZ and MMX's aren't exactly same ratio.Especially between the SNES and PSX X games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think harder motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre not the only one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Roll could be stealth if she hides or she could be huge fucking brute like her MvC2 special #$%
@#$ $#@ I knew of some of his other light dialogue, but I never knew of that one #$%
@#$ $#@ "Mega Man and Mega Man and Rock Man together in one game" is not a selling point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually scary how hard that boxart in-joke was banked on. #$%
@#$ $#@ I died a shit load getting this capsule as Zero, its really fucking hard to get it as him, and I dont blame anyone for not knowing about this dialogue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Duo could be purposely broken. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fast, could use his hugeass hand to block projectiles, dash by using that blue comet thing, and uses that hand blast and uppercut from Power Fighters. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a coup; they got the Powerpuff girls to cross over? #$%
@#$ $#@ All I remember is that this stages capsule was hard as balls to get without the falcon armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ How did you make it there with Zero? #$%
@#$ $#@ that roll is pretty cute I agree, maybe its the doe eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bought this Roll figure, and shes always in her MM8 attire. #$%
@#$ $#@ wasn't this made before that weird looking powerpuff girls 'remake' #$%
@#$ $#@ This, keep in mind Megaman Universe was being teased around the time of SFxTs development and release. #$%
@#$ $#@ If not for Street Fighter 4 already being a huge success, thered be no doubt that SFxT would have brought down the hammer on Capcom as a company. #$%
@#$ $#@ that remake was weird eeveryehere and twitchy Mojo was a big turnoff #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh god what the fuck is that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her MM8 self is pretty cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got it using jumper + hyper dash ...I think, it was a while, I just remember it being hard as hell to make it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That guy just really likes Roll. #$%
@#$ $#@ the name is only there to relate her to bad box art megaman technically. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay what the fuck is going on the right with the pipeworks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Classic MM8 Roll is top tier in all aspects, although Classic Roll, Ciel, and Prairie are pretty sweet as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre still great MM girls, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those fucking anime sequences were adorable and amazing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish wed have gotten a 10 minute long mini tie in. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fact that Quint went back in time, and that R-Shadow went back in time, both prevented that future from happening #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing bro I can bet my ass that if we showed that to 99% of people as low as age 14 and up whether neets or normies they would think the same, we are all fucked in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megaman hasn't had a shred of dignity since the late 80's when keiji 'the scam man' inafune took the reigns, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would pay good money to see a Roll animated short. #$%
@#$ $#@ NSMB is never a good option. #$%
@#$ $#@ Note I only said NSMB. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here for something with Mega Man. #$%
@#$ $#@ The servers are technically still up but good luck connecting via PPSSPP. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can alternatively just download a save and hope they have all the costumes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I might pick up a PSP or Vita sometime cheap in the future so I could probably just put PU on it and get the costumes there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zeros a cocky asshole, this has been true since his inception. #$%
@#$ $#@ i would buy that tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, you faggots ruin every Mega Man thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why dont you go post in a porn board or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better to let it pass with grace than be imaged dump-bumped a few dozen times before eventually giving up anyway is his mindset i think. #$%
@#$ $#@ These things are really cute, i really want to get one but without spending a thousand dollars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes still up on Amiami for around 30 bucks, I just checked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Totally new to that site, so that's not too bad if that's what those number point things mean. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah anyone who had any real significant, like SIGNIFICANT, praises for it were full of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was alright at best and certainly not TR. #$%
@#$ $#@ This was GOTY in my opinion. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the only games that made me sad when the credits started rolling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its become a cinematic game now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's the least buggy of all TR games though, so that's an improvement. #$%
@#$ $#@ Clash of clans didn't rape an existing franchise #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved the game, but yeah I agree with this completely. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the part where everybody but Lara was absolutely forgettable save maybe Roth or Sam and even Lara herself was a whirlwind of shit writing. #$%
@#$ $#@ AAA games being below expectations means they didnt sell 10000 billion copies to recoup the 300 million dollar advert budget. #$%
@#$ $#@ Generic and Insulting Charactarisation: The Game #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have it on PS3? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wanna play? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ Steam name? #$%
@#$ $#@ I aint rusing. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you add friends on mobile? #$%
@#$ $#@ The fanboys are laughable. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were poor quality TPS games with puzzles and acrobatics. #$%
@#$ $#@ The reboot is a decent quality TPS game with puzzles and acrobatics. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a huge fucking difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your reply. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt tomb raider but it was certainly a shit load better than uncharted. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats precisely why it was better than uncharted, uncharted was the same thing but it just throws bullshit jumps your way and it takes ages to climb around. #$%
@#$ $#@ While I do appreciate cute girls, I don't post them, so I'm not sure if I qualify as a cuteposter. #$%
@#$ $#@ How are the good games destroyed? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant, neither of those are especially valid ways to describe the reboot. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is not a thread, please try harder next time, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ here's your You #$%
@#$ $#@ at this point i've already conceded #$%
@#$ $#@ EEEEEVERYONE GEEET IN HEEURE #$%
@#$ $#@ And to think he just wanted to try out his Brewmaster/Iron Juggernaut deck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since when was it? #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything the problem is how hard it is to be successful using decks that arent meta picks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hearthstone has terrible balancing. #$%
@#$ $#@ This nasty slut #$%
@#$ $#@ People love that shit, I saw an Axe Flinger/bouncing blade combo it once it was dank as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try saying that on /hsg/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like for real, or any place with "competitive" players. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll go apeshit if you post a non-meta deck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hilariously, non-meta decks have a large advantage in hearthstone, which everyone just ignores. #$%
@#$ $#@ He normally caches them of guard though. #$%
@#$ $#@ you forgot the BRWWWUUUHH or whatever sound a ghoul makes #$%
@#$ $#@ But that is exactly what the pirate echo mage was and people were posting caps from that deck on there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go post dragon shaman or something and see how it goes for you m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you trying to imply? #$%
@#$ $#@ No one said magic had no meta. #$%
@#$ $#@ I went a to modern IQ yesterday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Five rounds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Played against Burn 3 times. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Magic too, but the game is not as diverse as you think #$%
@#$ $#@ So you are saying I am wrong and magic is just like hearthstone where everyone plays meta and you never see unique decks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also your argument seems flawed. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one stated magic was a place where every deck was unique, no shit it has its meta but it also has unique shit, which you almost never ever will see in hearthstone. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can go on MTGSalvation any time and find tons of brew decks and people discussing them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Recom works surprisingly well in this deck #$%
@#$ $#@ king of top decks #$%
@#$ $#@ what hunter tier set is that anyways, I feel like I've seen it before #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad the SJW took over Blizzard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sylvanus gets more covered up every time they show her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except we already know they nerfed the asses for the beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ funner than league mang #$%
@#$ $#@ Tournaments exist because people want to watch them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people like the absurd amount of RNG because it creates edge-of-your-seat moments. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not for me, but I can see why others watch it. #$%
@#$ $#@ she's aight but there isn't any other secrets counter #$%
@#$ $#@ What about cards that decrease in mana cost when you have overload? #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't know how you'll balance that out but eh. #$%
@#$ $#@ That would be retardedly op. #$%
@#$ $#@ How bad is your reading comprehension that you failed to realize I said that silencing Mad Scientist isnt a counter because it is risking not having a silence against really powerful cards? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think AlAkir is okay, I have some success with him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes not really that great at anything in particular, but he is versatile. #$%
@#$ $#@ As a finisher, hes alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at Grom, he costs 8 mana, is run as a finisher, and usually hits face for 12 damage as a 2-card combo with taskmaster or inner rage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Al'Akir's the same, he can finish with 1 rockbiter for 12 face damage, 2 rockbiters for 18 damage, and be placed next to flametongue for more damage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Admittedly, though, I think most people would rather combo rockbiters with doomhammer instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ pally friend here if he gets patron out then I've done something horribly wrong #$%
@#$ $#@ Patron vs Paladin is the second worst match up in the game, second only to Control Warrior vs Freeze Mage. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's almost unwinnable if the Patron doesn't get an unplayable hand. #$%
@#$ $#@ no i was gonna say something else but i forgot to upload a different image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Game came out of beta #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks even cooler in card form as you cant even see his eyes that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just looks like really big shadows. #$%
@#$ $#@ In my honest opinion, they should unnerf miracle rogue, if you notice around that time when it was so popular, cards like Lothab and Trogzor were made in reaction to it, but only Lothab kind of sees play today, although I do hope blizzards adds cards to counter patron warrior rather than nerf it, the deck doesn't have any RNG and it's solid for what it does. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember rubbing one out to this picture back in BC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good times. #$%
@#$ $#@ No because poisoned blade will never be played by anyone ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ INstead of nerfing any of the combo pieces, nerf all of warriors ridiculous removal, card draw, and armor gain that allows them to survive really easily until they get the combo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that class so much, people hate face hunter and secret pally and all that shit but Warrior is probably the least fun class to fight in the game in all its incarnations #$%
@#$ $#@ Found the Warrior player #$%
@#$ $#@ If best design means the best character then yeah hes really well designed! #$%
@#$ $#@ If best design does not mean broken as fuck then well.... #$%
@#$ $#@ all combos in hs are broken because there is no hand or deck disruption, but at some point they just decided to stop nerfing them while continuing to print more enablers in every set #$%
@#$ $#@ He is too focused on the target. #$%
@#$ $#@ He knew he would spill it, so he prepared more poison. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is mostly know as genzo in a chilean ccg #$%
@#$ $#@ This, if they just keep putting in more RNG shit it wont work. #$%
@#$ $#@ underrated post #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Warrior is the best class right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ So what? #$%
@#$ $#@ People have been saying the same for hunter and warlock and they were right. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were the best at some point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Warlock is always top tier because life tap and Hunter has always been viable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even after the UTH nerf everyone thought it was crap and then midrange hunter spawned and dominated the ladder. #$%
@#$ $#@ The meta will change eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ isn't this by a japanese artist #$%
@#$ $#@ It's korean, actually #$%
@#$ $#@ make the bots explosions able to hit any target, not just enemies #$%
@#$ $#@ His attack is too high, make him 6/7 #$%
@#$ $#@ Bestest bait #$%
@#$ $#@ Boombots deal damage 1-2 to anyone #$%
@#$ $#@ so you cant bgh? #$%
@#$ $#@ nice try anon more like make him cost 8 or 9 mana #$%
@#$ $#@ Its also a common. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just make one. #$%
@#$ $#@ That'd be Fel Reaver #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you running Paletress and Nexus-Champion Saraad in a deck without fencing coach? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that fencing coach is that great in priest, but still, seems like a strange choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not the same guy but brawl is easy to play around, just play minions that stick on the board i.e. #$%
@#$ $#@ piloted shredder, sludge belcher, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting brawled with only 2 or 3 minions on the board is not that bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you really think it's imbalanced than you need to learn the game more, because it isn't imbalanced at lower or higher level play. #$%
@#$ $#@ All classes have good cards that give them an edge and a reason to be played. #$%
@#$ $#@ good thing it's a fun deck type #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Tier 5 #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know if this is shitposting or not, but if you have two minions on the board, or even 3 minions on the board like I said, you are effectively playing around brawl. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you are so bad at the game that you dont know how much is an over-commital to brawl, then you need to figure that shit out through playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ A lot of new players think cards like flamestrike are imbalanced, but its not, and can easily be played around through playing fewer minions or higher health minions. #$%
@#$ $#@ With brawl you just dont overcommit or you play sticky minions on the board. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not that hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Learn to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is literally,garbage #$%
@#$ $#@ That is literally, the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ EL CARTACLISMO #$%
@#$ $#@ is that where the "ALL MINIONS" card comes from? #$%
@#$ $#@ The link is probably still up. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know the person making it updated after the grand tournament so he hasn't been C&amp;D'd yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ no time for games? #$%
@#$ $#@ So, when will blizzard update their game with it ? #$%
@#$ $#@ that's a cool mod #$%
@#$ $#@ i love malylock, more fun than handlock but not as consistent it feels sometimes #$%
@#$ $#@ no, its usually worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ /hsg/ is 30% people talking about Twitch streams, 20% calling each other Shieldbearers, and 50% trying to convince people playing Patron takes skill #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the "no bottom jaw" forsaken face option, on the left here #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you not play WoW or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Undead have a jawless face option. #$%
@#$ $#@ he has no lower jaw, and the pink part is the exposed bits of his neck and throat #$%
@#$ $#@ Boom bam bop botta bot bomp pow #$%
@#$ $#@ Where can I get this mod/how do I mod this game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, let down #$%
@#$ $#@ Any particular standouts? #$%
@#$ $#@ post auchenai #$%
@#$ $#@ Make him a 7/5 or 7/6 so more 5-6 drops can at least trade with Boom himself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Going 1-1 with Boom still leaves the 2 bots behind and there are almost no 5-6 drops with 7 attack. #$%
@#$ $#@ No it didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ The classic set and naxx, the oldest expansions, still have a ton of good cards that make up the majority of most decks. #$%
@#$ $#@ In fact the classic set is way better than the newest expansion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, umod only affects your side and what you view, you have to start it up every time you want to play the game, but it doesnt affect anything within the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ It cant even change text. #$%
@#$ $#@ I use it for MMOs like TERA. #$%
@#$ $#@ 7, PhD of Balance #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you like playing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shredder and Boom are two of the most universally used cards, but I would craft more staple common/rares before dumping 1600 dust on anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly looking it up, her official art is probably better looking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im Spiderman. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 leper gnomes, a river crocolisk, and an ooze. #$%
@#$ $#@ mustard-&gt;hero power is 5 #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wouldnt suggest crafting common cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're cheap, sure, but after 30 or so packs in any set you'll have 99% of the common cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just a waste of dust in the long term. #$%
@#$ $#@ Save the dust for legendaries, which the odds of getting duplicates of are very low. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should just switch him and Hemet Nessingwarrys ability, would make more sense and be more balanced since Hemet is a 5 drop... #$%
@#$ $#@ And it would still see play #$%
@#$ $#@ Turn 5 violet teacher, coin, defias #$%
@#$ $#@ Priest is the class Ive used the most. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mage and Hunter are what Ive used most after Priest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id prefer to make a bunch of cheap strong cards than go for one legendary. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well then with Mage you should probably craft all the mech cards I recommended, or just stop buying a lot of Goblin n Gnomes packs to get them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mech decks are extremely cheap, but very powerful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the tips. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill try to focus on building up Mage and Priest for now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, color makes a ton of difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this effect golden cards at all, or would that be asking too much? #$%
@#$ $#@ They never intended this to be a serious game, it's like people who take melee serious and then complain it's unbalanced #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you think all board games are serious as well? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is connect 4 serious? #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess who? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just pick up Magic or Yugioh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont know anything about Magic, but Yugioh has can be played for free online with access to all cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ You expect anything of worth from the jewiest company in vidya? #$%
@#$ $#@ But...but patron and combo druid do exactly the same fucking thing... #$%
@#$ $#@ No shit they went with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes them money. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I don't think they ever intended it to be a big e-sport, it was fags like Amaz who pushed that #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes exactly, his post is calling Blizzard hypocrites because of OTKs that still exist with just different cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Itll never work for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes like the most watched streamer on twitch, but only because of hearthstone. #$%
@#$ $#@ He tried playing other big name games like GTAV and such and his viewers dropped to like 6k #$%
@#$ $#@ From what I recall, a lot of the bigger name streamers play other card games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know at least one nigga plays Vanguard. #$%
@#$ $#@ NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS #$%
@#$ $#@ Like Harrison but for secrets, I like it #$%
@#$ $#@ TRIGGER DISCIPLINE #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that zone #$%
@#$ $#@ It was fun trying to knock them off the bridge. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got my ass beat by the minotaur in my first gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I still had screens of my Secret World dude; such a solid game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh well, heres some APB before shit got P2W as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does that really have a solid US release date? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not yet, but the first CBT is October 30th. #$%
@#$ $#@ Currently slated for early 2016 though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Angela Merkel for chancellor #$%
@#$ $#@ Got your back fam #$%
@#$ $#@ haha yeah! #$%
@#$ $#@ Kazuhira "Benedict" Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ Big Boss #$%
@#$ $#@ Kazuhira "cucks for ten bucks" Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, it is Benedict "Kazuhira" Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ McDonnel Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ Without your aid it wouldve taken me a while to figure that out as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually it's McDonell Benedict "Kazuhira" Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually it's Master McDonell Benedict "Kazuhira" Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ Never, EVER they said. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats now how you spell Strider. #$%
@#$ $#@ strider is a poor man's assassin #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't be so happy now that PCucks are going to shit all over it #$%
@#$ $#@ texture mods, I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt that second screen for dark arisen? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant understand how people can play without Skull Splitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ its good #$%
@#$ $#@ We're forced to be here on /v/ and listen to your guys' bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, gtaV, MGSV, you guys just like to shit post and complain #$%
@#$ $#@ at least you can still get the original Dragon's Dogma experience #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, its powered by MT Framework so it should run like a dream, but they also managed to fuck up DMC4SE compared to the original so who knows. #$%
@#$ $#@ And by fuck up I mean you cant get 200+ FPS anymore like you could in DMC4. #$%
@#$ $#@ DD was already trashed everywhere, you whiny cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Must I repost the player reviews? #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop shitposting PCfat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Weve had enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get fucked, poorfag. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will enjoy Dark Arisen again and theres nothing you can do. #$%
@#$ $#@ like you implied poor port of special edition is largely bullshit inflated by the internet. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's still a great port compared to usual shit we get from japanese developers, you just can't reach ridiculous frame rate you could in the original dmc4. #$%
@#$ $#@ mgs5 is simply an outright amazing scalable port. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember some people complaining about Revelations 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll never get your fucking grubby mitts on it #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, we knew this yeas ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ If DDO is any indication its going to look alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is going to be an awesome as hell release, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sure about that, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember them confirming 4k resolution, not textures. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4k textures has not been confirmed, only that they are higher resolution than original. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4K display resolution has been confirmed. #$%
@#$ $#@ My bad, I need sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is probably a very fair conclusion. #$%
@#$ $#@ you can get a wired 360 controller for like $20 dude, if you're on windows it's just plug n play for every game #$%
@#$ $#@ add ToDefeatYou. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill help your nig. #$%
@#$ $#@ teach him how to pick cotton too #$%
@#$ $#@ Perfect Assassin combo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Almost as bad as mine. #$%
@#$ $#@ keep the shroud on #$%
@#$ $#@ you get to decide where to fast travel as long as you put a fast travel crystal there. #$%
@#$ $#@ also only on world map #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes but you need ferrystones one time use to fast travel and portcrystals a waypoint item to set locations #$%
@#$ $#@ You eyeballin me? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's /v/ now, FUCKING EGORAPTOR was in the episode #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres always the possibility of Rick just hating cobs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not how you use meme arrows anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Friggin DK64. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people who watch Rick &amp; Morty never shut the fuck up about it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are they always the most annoying faggots? #$%
@#$ $#@ OP didnt mention Rick &amp; Morty. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU mentioned Rick &amp; Morty you horrid Rick &amp; Morty mentioner. #$%
@#$ $#@ i love you sara #$%
@#$ $#@ Legion will balance it out and bring it back to its glory. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont bash bc and wrath, cata is where it went downhill. #$%
@#$ $#@ The recession ended and everybody found work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Garrison, Shipyard, Apexis, lack of content, flying whiners, no interesting daily hubs, profession changes, welfare legendary that punishes you for unsubscribing, mount rewards being recoloured models of shop mounts, etc #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi, Derek. #$%
@#$ $#@ First you need money, poorfag #$%
@#$ $#@ good thing i pirate games then #$%
@#$ $#@ How would they run out of money? #$%
@#$ $#@ They have it pouring in from all kinds of places. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're literally using their most crowdfunded 'thing' ever status to sell their donation platform to other companies #$%
@#$ $#@ Same way anyone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ More expenses than income. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are cancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rei is cute #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, thats stupid too, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot cocktail mixing sim Derek #$%
@#$ $#@ $40, but that was supporting the initial kickstarter back in 12. #$%
@#$ $#@ Back when kickstarter was a big thing everyone was throwing money at. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly I feel more of a sucker for giving Doublefine money, and that was only $15. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get those clicks while you can. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna need it to pay the legal bills. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is a game having development difficulties make it a scam though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey guys #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot to add that $90 of that went towards gifts for my friends #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, Roberts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't you mean your clanmates that you're never actually going to play a video game with? #$%
@#$ $#@ $125, if it goes south I could careless #$%
@#$ $#@ I kind of want ED but I know that the only way I'd properly enjoy it would be with joysticks and some VR tech, but seeing as I won't buy any VR tech until they've been out for a while it'll be a while before I play it #$%
@#$ $#@ No, people Ive known since middle school. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were currently on ARK with 7 other IRL friends/roommates, which was gifted to me by one of the two people I gifted the package to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right, Joysticks are a must. #$%
@#$ $#@ VR headsets less so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been using it with my Crystal Cove Rift and its fine, but Ill play it just as much with the goggles off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe even moreso. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game certainly doesn't lose anything when it's just a screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy is a loli. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly I enjoyed the the dogfighting freebee a few weeks ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Star marine looks fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am worried about the whole persistent universe thing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ seems plausible #$%
@#$ $#@ I have E:D and a decent joystick set up and barely play it because I dont have VR. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game really, really needs head tracking at the very least and I dont feel like buying a TrackIR setup when actual head tracking VR is coming so soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look up 38 studios #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask DoubleFine #$%
@#$ $#@ Literal autism. #$%
@#$ $#@ My company doesnt have ID cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ We have RFID keyfobs to let us in and out, but theres nothing identifying about them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glorious genius Chris Roberts has memorised all employees and can mentally detect which are or arent when they walk through the doors using state of the art not yet made space sim technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes they need it for a lawsuit, fuck making a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ $2000 at least #$%
@#$ $#@ sure, go ahead shovel more money into Roberts blow fund. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id have agreed with you if you had said Oolite instead of Elite Dangerous. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing people invested in a universe of a game that's not exist yet is quite entertaining, at least from the comfy of my home and monitor #$%
@#$ $#@ So 9 different people conspired to make fake RFID keycards and contacted the Escapist in order to smear CIG who dindu nuffin wrong? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey man. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think a company that big didn't have any ID card. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe some sort of identification object such as nametag or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Knowing the head of the company it's probably some sort of PDA or something #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just shedding light on their shit tier verification process friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ the superman 64 part is spot on #$%
@#$ $#@ Star Citizen is the Gizmodo for the kids today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, sounds more like youre desperately trying to rationalize your $12,000 ship. #$%
@#$ $#@ epic shitpost #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you defending CIG on /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shouldnt you be giving pity dollars to Roberts right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ That actually doesn't disprove their timeline #$%
@#$ $#@ Shouldnt you be in your star citizen hanger looking at your fleet? #$%
@#$ $#@ No one does this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get out of here Roberts. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is getting sad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dibs on the WCS for your cap ship, please? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre really showing how impartial and unbiased you are now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty easy to be impartial when you don't have a vested interest in some sketchy clickbait site that you've pinned your flag to #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh huh, youre totally neutral. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why you started pulling up stocks for no reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only reason I can see for why people would shill for a games journalism website this hard is because they're invested in it in some way and are now experiencing some heavy buyers remorse #$%
@#$ $#@ Your insults are lazy and unoriginal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like you. #$%
@#$ $#@ yep, x-rebirth fell apart because it didnt have good looking ships #$%
@#$ $#@ how much did you back SC for? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know much about Star Citizen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I came into these threads to talk about shitty clickbait games journalism as is common on this board. #$%
@#$ $#@ Turns out there's a bunch of people here who are suddenly really against that if the article in question pushes a particular narrative they like and think the escapist is the 'chosen one' that's immune to the shit this report would get if it was by any other site #$%
@#$ $#@ what way was it put together? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck do you care? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you're confused, this is /v/, not /goofergooby/ #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to go to bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just imagine that we did this back and forth for another 300 posts #$%
@#$ $#@ $92,000,000+ in backing and cultish fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Former investigative journalist, software engineer, game developer, is there anything xie cant do? #$%
@#$ $#@ About $10,000 give or take. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not poor so Ill obviously wont be losing any sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I can't help but think the money would've been better spent finally remodeling the theater. #$%
@#$ $#@ In any case it should be done before the new Star Wars anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit looks comfy as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ mah nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe when humanity reaches the stars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aren't you able to play it's pre-alpha stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah but they never post progress updates or update it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone remember this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt they just post a big progress update on whatever? #$%
@#$ $#@ Aside from the weekly and monthly progress updates, and the ~monthly game updates. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those dont count though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this supposed to look impressive? #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im positive that is some kind of ship. #$%
@#$ $#@ reminds me of this tbh lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like a fucking IKEA store #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you let cancer grow? #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean everyone dies eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pray tell, anon, how would the game speak for itself regarding whether or not Sandi Gardiner refused to hire people for being a black girl, or for looking like they have a hairy snatch? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are people buying all this shit arent even able to fucking play? #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything offered by CIG can be earned in game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont have to pay beyond getting the game to get what others have spent 1000USD+ on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your homework: design a way to crowdfund a game and reward backers proportionally to their contribution without giving them anything exclusive or of use in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then come back and talk shit about the model, instead of pretending like its a released freemium game with p2w. #$%
@#$ $#@ A NU CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE #$%
@#$ $#@ what game? #$%
@#$ $#@ i'm honestly hoping the new mass effect game turns out to be good, i don't care about trannies just give me back fun space games. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ likes to pretend the average person is aware or cares about any of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why are people calling it p2w? #$%
@#$ $#@ If it's inherently flawed, what's your solution? #$%
@#$ $#@ Never crowdfund anything ever? #$%
@#$ $#@ CIGs done a pretty good job limiting the p2w in their model. #$%
@#$ $#@ Backers get ships, but anyone who just buys the game can earn the same stuff in-game and they wont sell ships when the game is released. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm looking around and outside of /v/ and the few relevant communities, nobody is really talking about this #$%
@#$ $#@ Arent you unable to get the best ships and stuff via money anyway? #$%
@#$ $#@ And arent there private servers that make the whole thing irrelevant? #$%
@#$ $#@ yes but if you play on private servers you cant have thousands of gibbering fourteen year olds trying to shoot you and calling you a fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just about to post this exact quote and video. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only Derek Smart could have known. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny that you say 14 because i bet that most of these morons are going to be 30+ who are trying to justify thousands of dollars on digital shit theyll never touch #$%
@#$ $#@ Correct, the most powerful ship you can buy is basically a civilianized decommissioned destroyer with no military hardware on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant buy the five or six capital classes of ship bigger than it at all, nor can you buy any ship with military hardware, not even a fighter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres certainly putting quite a lot of work into this scam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please, this sounds like someone dropped their moms credit card on a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Define "scam." #$%
@#$ $#@ No-one in these threads ever does. #$%
@#$ $#@ I give you that Derek Smart isnt probably the best person to criticize the whole situation, but you can give him massive props for calling this shit first. #$%
@#$ $#@ So your point is that if they fuck it up, its fucked up? #$%
@#$ $#@ By any chance are you under the delusion that you win a lot of arguments, and people think youre an idiot? #$%
@#$ $#@ future jobs, would you hire someone who was willing to talk shit about their employers online? #$%
@#$ $#@ you are literally retarded or still are retarded ironic shitposter #$%
@#$ $#@ Therell never ever be one so you might as well kill yourself, dumb feelposter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, so it's the "I have no idea what I'm talking about" option. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's 18000 dollars because your retarded country steals 3000 dollars if you want to buy something that costs 15, and the 20 thousand dollar "ship" you think exists because you don't know how to click a mouse and find out what you get for that money is actually like 20 ships. #$%
@#$ $#@ 120e for a year*11 = 1320 #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like he spent it all on botox and a fake tan #$%
@#$ $#@ kek that's even worse #$%
@#$ $#@ Why you gotta hate derek? #$%
@#$ $#@ is it because you cant afford 42 million dollar drinks? #$%
@#$ $#@ autism bux anon #$%
@#$ $#@ stay mad #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly expected Kotaku or Polygon to pick up this story, but apparently they already did a story on Star Citizen about a month and a half ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right of reply is a crucial part of journalism...but vidya bloggers and reviewers arent real journalists. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all, unless it's about cis privileged scum #$%
@#$ $#@ oh wow is that for real, i did not see that shit before but its downright sad #$%
@#$ $#@ What bait would be complete without shoehorning muh racism into it #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the same people who believe in Too big to fail marketed slurs #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Space Rangers blows everyone out any day #$%
@#$ $#@ less than half of that #$%
@#$ $#@ less than half of that of what? #$%
@#$ $#@ ~3-4 years id estimate, your figures are underwhelming for expenses #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet this guy buys all the DLC for train sim. #$%
@#$ $#@ epic, simply epic #$%
@#$ $#@ procedural generation is the nigger of gaming industry, just sayin' #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Derek. #$%
@#$ $#@ who cucked who #$%
@#$ $#@ costs are much much higher #$%
@#$ $#@ I can tell you have some sort of autism or furfaggotry from your post. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't give a fuck about kotaku, read what I was responding to, it is the same "argument" he was making #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes motherfucker it was exaggeration #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea I was exaggerating. #$%
@#$ $#@ For people saying CIG is out of money, CIG would have to make some REALLY stupid finical decision. #$%
@#$ $#@ In seriousness I would knock the salaries down to $80k. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the fact that the 261 people were not working on the game since the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ So that has a huge factor on money. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the other investors in SC that we dont know about makes a huge deal. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game has plenty of money left. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to exaggerate the numbers to so they are out of money #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you give Duke Nukem forever a chance when it came out? #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder they want to make a huge universe with shittons of systems, planets and space stations to explore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not empty regions of space and a hangar. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should team up with the people making the no man sky vapourware #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I dont really like video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know this is a video game board but I just come here to talk shit about your garbage medium. #$%
@#$ $#@ cig can still bankrupt them in legal costs #$%
@#$ $#@ All they need to prove is willful disregard for the truth of the matter before running to print. #$%
@#$ $#@ The 24 hour deadline for CIG to respond that the escapist didnt even keep up their end of the bargain on should be pretty clear indication of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ That spam folder excuse is pretty flimsy, theres no reason they should have been THAT rushed to print the thing unless they knew it was likely false. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre owned by Viacom though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also if you lose a libel case, you have to pay the other sides costs for lawyers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know what it means for Star Citizen to come out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldn't the fact that they claimed they would give them the chance to respond and then didn't bother to print the response be pretty good proof of malice or at the very least incredible negligence? #$%
@#$ $#@ That spam folder excuse doesn't really hold up in the era of instant communication when they could easily do a double check with CIG to make sure that they weren't interested in commenting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could make some vanilla with you right now #$%
@#$ $#@ Tentacles ruined the Wakfu flash #$%
@#$ $#@ depends on how you use them #$%
@#$ $#@ he said "boring" not "flooring" #$%
@#$ $#@ you dont think a giant octopus invading a supple young woman can actually happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think of all the fetishes and kinks out there its one of the more plausible, given that octopuses feel out crevices and such naturally #$%
@#$ $#@ But they wouldn't do it in a manner that's sexually pleasing to a human. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know man, they have a lot of suction #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess so. #$%
@#$ $#@ At this point for me its all just so mashed together that i dont bat an eye at what some people would find outlandish as a fetish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Painful suction. #$%
@#$ $#@ some people love pain, throw one of them in and they'd be moaning plenty #$%
@#$ $#@ They have teeth all over those suction pads. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything that would be painful, not pleasurable. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno why, but that's going in the folder #$%
@#$ $#@ feet, bdsm, inflation, /ss/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe I'd have cared years ago #$%
@#$ $#@ He said that when the times come, hell retire with that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that squid only? #$%
@#$ $#@ [citation needed] #$%
@#$ $#@ No, not really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that your idea of good animation? #$%
@#$ $#@ Feet, They think they're special snow flakes in the world of fetishes when feet are pretty damn basic #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah rape tentacles are worse but honestly I think its more important to have dick tentacles that look decent. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't want the flacid looking pointy tentacles, and I don't want urethral penetration. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigger I will fight you #$%
@#$ $#@ tentacles are just old dude show some respect you fucking child #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is why theyre boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too lewd #$%
@#$ $#@ Foot fetishists are pretty annoying and loud about their fetish too, even more so than futafags. #$%
@#$ $#@ Name us more recent "cooler" fetishes you fucking retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Floor tiles and the state of Ohio. #$%
@#$ $#@ My state best state. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Zone's complete lack of emotion #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why I like all this NTR and Cheating shit over vanilla. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats where shit starts getting real life. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty sure redminus made a flash about this years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks doc #$%
@#$ $#@ Amateur lesbians #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to understand that fetishists do not operate like normal people. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant slap on logic to a person who is, at least very partially, mentally broken. #$%
@#$ $#@ By your logic nobody is normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ virgin detectioned #$%
@#$ $#@ Leaning against a wall while birds poop on your back #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a dead beaten horse. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know exactly what I mean you faggoty little pseudopsychologist #$%
@#$ $#@ hunters now deflect grenades. #$%
@#$ $#@ theres a webm going around of it, but I didnt save it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, most elites now pull out swords once youre in close range. #$%
@#$ $#@ lore reason being because swords are no longer a ceremonial top tier weapons that the covenant made them out to be #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats pretty dope. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope that the elite minors and other regular troops just charge you with with their swords and are pretty predictable, but former elite zealots or whatever should have better technique and actually pose a threat to the player. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're the one who can use anything and switch anytime, that's your thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also youre the commander, thats youe role. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man 343 really suck at armour design, which is a shame because that was my favorite thing about 3/Reach. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo Online #$%
@#$ $#@ Absolutely disgusting. #$%
@#$ $#@ There already is Halo multiplayer on PC #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, I would be more upset at 343 for turning Mickey into an Innie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Talk about pants on head retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ They also introduced reticle bloom and the concept of an inaccurate starting weapon, while Halo 5 is working to abolish that sort of thinking. #$%
@#$ $#@ He joined because of his hatred of the covenant after the war he had no purpose so he said fuck it back to the old ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ they implanted the genes and john is the culmination of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tell that to master chief. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gritty Halo a shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun for me is landing those jumps. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun is an subjective word. #$%
@#$ $#@ Confirmed for not playing mcc. #$%
@#$ $#@ most of those campaings are set on the easiest like if you look at the hunter video those are on heroic and up scales where hunters dont take your shit with the nades. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its because they're all playing on easy #$%
@#$ $#@ From the sounds of it, its a free ghost that could make or break your match. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343s over designed aesthetic is so bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks more appropriate for a giant mech anime than for power armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but I didnt know that sprint, ground pound, etc, were opinions. #$%
@#$ $#@ And what was that reason? #$%
@#$ $#@ What did we gain from its removal? #$%
@#$ $#@ Da powah of da cloud in co-op? #$%
@#$ $#@ a game that actually runs at 60FPS because it doesn't need to be scaled down to accommodate for splitscreen being a playable framerate #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I see the source of the confusion; Im referring to LAN, not splitscreen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still a bit miffed about it, and Id take 720p and a halved framerate any day of the week over its removal unless 343 went full retard and didnt use delta timing or something, but I understand that there was a trade-off involved. #$%
@#$ $#@ My question is, what was the compromise with the removal of LAN? #$%
@#$ $#@ What did we gain in exchange for the loss? #$%
@#$ $#@ premium is 2 times a week for 7 weeks only and then its gone. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not permanent. #$%
@#$ $#@ u wot, most people I know and I loved the beta, there were a few problems, sure, but fo the most part it was really good, and the entire point of the beta is to get feedback to change shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then the list of changes they made addressed pretty much every complaint I saw that was common. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, it did all of those before Halo 5. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except LAN is more like a concept right now, rather than a singular object. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ever heard of WLAN or Connectify? #$%
@#$ $#@ can I get these in Linda flavor? #$%
@#$ $#@ wheres my fred flavor ? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I had friends too buddy #$%
@#$ $#@ No I havent which bring back to the point I made that they are going to appeal to the people who give them the most $$$. #$%
@#$ $#@ i've seen the linda flavor posted earlier but people thought it was fred it wasn't you can clearly see the extra scopes on the side of her head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once you grow up, the ones you have will just live far away anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Invalidating this argument even more. #$%
@#$ $#@ You do plan on going to post-highschool don't you anon, to meet people away from your parent's home? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, chill. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played Halo 4 splitscreen too I never noticed anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you getting so mad #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but he doesnt seem very mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ And hes right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having two players in online, or three or more in local, murdered the framerate. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game had too many particle effects for its own good. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 has retconned literally everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's literally not true #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt see it as shitposting, just ranting because I think 343 is a bunch of morons who want to do good things with Halo but dont know how to do it and Im bitter about it because I used to love the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not a retcon, thats covenants culture changing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prophets dead = not as many traditions and religious parts withheld = more elites using powerful energy sword. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because the story retcons it doesn't mean it's not a retcon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyve killed off or are working to kill off any trace of bungie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pathetic at this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ 60fps is undeniably superior in first person shooters #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 mk V? #$%
@#$ $#@ this sounds like the ambassador has no idea what the fuck youre talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, add armor to the hips, and remove the flippers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Religion =\= honor #$%
@#$ $#@ 10/10 GOTYAY all is forgiven #$%
@#$ $#@ Son, am I gonna have to show you the definition of autism or am I just gonna have to smack a bitch? #$%
@#$ $#@ My god. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre absolutely right, haha. #$%
@#$ $#@ I must have autism, its just never been diagnosed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its a new kind of autism that can only be detected by butthurt /v/irgins on an anonymous imageboard!!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you better reread your post and diagnose for autism, because youre quadruple-exclamanation-posting. #$%
@#$ $#@ epic win bro #$%
@#$ $#@ But they had to go out of their way to NOT have LAN, they took it the fuck out so youd be forced to have an online subscription to use your own fucking local network. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats great and all, but fuck you for starting this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now the word autism is being thrown at me all crazy #$%
@#$ $#@ Not raging, no sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a little annoyed is all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not this #$%
@#$ $#@ What, I was literally just explaining how tick rates and frame rates work? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then stop being autistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ You've already lost that discussion, and now you're just showing how much of a massive fucking faggot you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop proving my point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ambassadors half the time have no fucking clue what theyre talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ That person is a prime example #$%
@#$ $#@ You better be able to choose your character in single player as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly though, why cant 343 just implement split-screen through this cloud bullshit we keep hearing? #$%
@#$ $#@ If Crackdown can have offload their destruction physics to the internet, Im sure 343 can figure out how to offload some of the workload through an internet connection. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, sure, requiring an internet connection for split-screen is kind of shitty, but that's Microsoft's fault for not designing the console with enough power. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is definitely autism #$%
@#$ $#@ H2A shouldve been Halo 3, i mean every thing in the H2A feels so right and sounds right as well, but then again its just me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Made me laugh #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Linda, Fred, and Kelly are all way more important than Rookie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus, they actually have personality. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were not talking about Blue Team. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were talking about Osiris. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to spend half of the game pretending to care about three people who are brand new to the franchise. #$%
@#$ $#@ He could have only played Halo Wars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks pretty good, might be enough for me to buy an xbone #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats actually not bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shame that Halo 5 is the only xbone game that convinces me at all, since I just cant justify dropping the money on one at this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ in Crackdowns case, the cloud only helps with the physics which in that game is primarily cpu based aka when the primary cpu gets exhausted, the buildings being destructed move to another server on the cloud. #$%
@#$ $#@ they can't magically make the servers in the cloud transfer into one mega-computer, that's not how it works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything that is not Karen traviss is good to great and is worth reading. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just look at the wiki pages for the travissties #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, John #$%
@#$ $#@ Also What did I miss between halo 4 to halo 5, because there seems to be a massive gap. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not up to date with all of this different author stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ But what is so bad about Karen Traviss? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen repeatably that a majority of readers and Halo fans hate her work. #$%
@#$ $#@ The comic series goes through it. #$%
@#$ $#@ John meets up with the rest of Blue Team and goes on missions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Black Team jobs to the Didact who came back and then the Didact gets promptly taken down by Blue Team. #$%
@#$ $#@ Demarco from Spartan Ops dies cause Spartan IVs seem to have traitors everywhere, Thorne takes over Majestic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halsey wrecks Palmer over the origins of the Spartan program. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats about it actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is buck a spartan? #$%
@#$ $#@ And where did MC find his team mates? #$%
@#$ $#@ Buck becoming a Spartan is detailed in New Blood, a book which pissed off a lot of people, because Rookie gets executed by rebels and Mickey turns traitor, leaving Buck and Romeo to become S-IVs #$%
@#$ $#@ It comes with the Xbox elite over 20lbs pussy and ass edition console. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow a minor hard drive upgrade justifies a 90 dollar mark-up. #$%
@#$ $#@ It comes with halo 5 limited edition, a special controller, special console. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is in the limited? #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, "traitor" is a matter of perspective. #$%
@#$ $#@ He had a pretty good point in his motivation. #$%
@#$ $#@ He signed up because humanity was on the verge of extinction by a relentless onslaught from an alien conglomerate which vastly outmatched them in numbers, strength, and technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ He didnt sign up to kill other people for political reasons. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 did a really good job with Blue Teams armor #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything but the statue and a small little thing that only comes in the collectors edition. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ Look on the bright side: they cant possibly do a shittier job in making us care about them than Bungie did with Noble team in Reach. #$%
@#$ $#@ forge mode #$%
@#$ $#@ seconding this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't seen it yet but judging from the image and anons reaction it can only be good #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck thats retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe because it literally looks like fucking dog shit #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck 343, that armor is like babies first zbrush model tier #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont like the helmet and the armor sucks compared to other games but I legitimately think this is the best looking set I've seen so far #$%
@#$ $#@ No bro he needs flame shoulders and 3 katanas #$%
@#$ $#@ That undersuit looks black. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you gonna believe me or your lying eyes? #$%
@#$ $#@ You just had to make your own thread instead of going to /vg/ or posting in the other faggy undertale threads #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes asking about other RPGs, dipshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off and stop trying to make everything your personal boogeyman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice samefag bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try this other game called fez. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not samefagging, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre just trying to start shit and make the thread into what you think it should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant delete your own thread, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not trying to make another undertale thread, just more curious about what to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry m8. #$%
@#$ $#@ RPGs are fucking littered with RNGs. #$%
@#$ $#@ If youre fucking bad, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ How on earth does personal skill somehow change the fact that RPGs tend to rely on RNGs? #$%
@#$ $#@ What RPGs are you playing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Timed hits, skill management, and using adequate moves during turns. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously git gud nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ You didnt even read what I posted, you mouth breather. #$%
@#$ $#@ And you didnt even read the OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should stop posting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre fucking dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your personal skill level is accurately predicting the outcome by using the skills learned by your character. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you don't have the mental capacity to understand that X move will defeat this enemy with a 90% rate or Y move will defeat enemies with a 10% crit rate then you're dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ He says RPGs are entirely luck-based. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that they contain RNG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now stop arguing against someone when you don't even know what you're arguing about. #$%
@#$ $#@ RNG doesnt equate to being luck based. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be luck based youd have to have RNG as a central mechanic with little to no mechanics to mitigate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most RPGs dont fit that category. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats your screen resolution, faggot? #$%
@#$ $#@ 1366 x 768 #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't run as long as you're green. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ Just make out already #$%
@#$ $#@ westerners truly are unoriginal as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ "Luck-based" implies that the core fundamental of the game is luck, and that luck is the only thing that determines your success. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is false, and youre shit at games if you disagree and are justifying being bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, its unlucky. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thankfully it's not the sole factor that determines whether or not you succeed, but if it is, then you're an idiot for getting yourself into a situation where that will happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sorry, is your wife pregnant with your neighbors chocolate child and youre only now projecting the guilt for it on /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why else would you care? #$%
@#$ $#@ What creature is that in the OPs pic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Undertale character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I already knew that. #$%
@#$ $#@ But whats it called? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it have a name? #$%
@#$ $#@ If I expand upon that to include those hypotheticals you're listing, are you going to whine that I'm "editing the scenario"? #$%
@#$ $#@ fuckin what games uses mechanics like this? #$%
@#$ $#@ His name is just Monster Kid #$%
@#$ $#@ he's literally just monster kid #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah hes sans #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for answering my question. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy christ, do you not understand the concept of "hypothetical scenarios"? #$%
@#$ $#@ its name is monster kid #$%
@#$ $#@ like that some word for when you do things high? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck thats great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Faggot used to mean a bundle of sticks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get over it, autists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you forcing yourself to play it if you arent enjoying it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is someone holding a fucking gun to your head? #$%
@#$ $#@ FF: Tactics and Fire Emblem #$%
@#$ $#@ You have no choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to reset the game you need to sell your soul. #$%
@#$ $#@ I figured that, but how long do I have to wait here? #$%
@#$ $#@ You gotta close the game, reopen it and wait for Chara again. #$%
@#$ $#@ 10 minutes upon reopening the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm going to restart the game and construct a better party because I'm a retard for not including someone with buffs or debuffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is why you do Neutral - Pacifist runs FIRST, then uninstall the game after you finish genocide. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I do have an answer to it: dont be shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fun part is that in 99% of rpgs you can fuck horribly with what you do with your characters and win battles anyways, or just grind past them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which of the two swords is the less shitty option in the scenario listed. #$%
@#$ $#@ It depends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me a list of all the enemies in the current area and their stats, skills, and abilities, and the endboss of the areas stats, skills, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he picks the consistent sword youll say he doesnt have enough DPS and if he picks the strong sword youll claim he dies to RNG and this somehow means every RPG is entirely luck-based because of your shitty metaphor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neutral master race tbh fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, which is calling the OP a retard for saying RPGs are luck-based. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you disagree with him, you're agreeing with OP's statement that they are luck-based. #$%
@#$ $#@ There isnt one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you ask? #$%
@#$ $#@ Expanding into what? #$%
@#$ $#@ A hypothetical scenario that will never exist outside a shitty babbys first RPG maker game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, thats not a sound argument. #$%
@#$ $#@ The purpose of this exercise is to analyze a single variable that could potentially be expounded into a more detailed setting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Specifically, a scenario that relies on RNG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, I never said anything like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You put those words in my mouth in a desperate plea to prove you dont suck shit at games. #$%
@#$ $#@ So much for not responding to me, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which Megami Tensei game offers best introduction to the series? #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT and EO #$%
@#$ $#@ Etrian Odyssey series if you like dungeon crawls #$%
@#$ $#@ You can still roll misses, and if your DM is going to baby your party and save it from letting anyone die and nullifying misses and shit, you must be playing some boring DD #$%
@#$ $#@ Prepare to have creepy endings to your pacifist runs! #$%
@#$ $#@ You deserve the pain. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, youll need to heal - just do it quickly. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you time it right, you can navigate the menu without getting hit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, whats the best healing item? #$%
@#$ $#@ I only have 1 steak and shit tons of glam burgers. #$%
@#$ $#@ mettaton steak, the sandwiches from the hotel, and snowman pieces #$%
@#$ $#@ That's nice, but JRPGs aren't luck-based. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad we could agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll want the ramen from the lab and the pie - those both heal full HP something like 90 HP at LV 19 #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess I should backtrack before progressing, getting to the first little intervention without having to heal is a nice step forward though. #$%
@#$ $#@ You said they arent luck-based, which means you agree with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did not say that. #$%
@#$ $#@ you can get a total of 3 snowman pieces, but according to the other anons, theres better healing items than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now this is shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got me there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but OP was making a point for luck based, not skill based combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other than that I see your point. #$%
@#$ $#@ related somehow to Sans and Papyrus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a lot of weird shit found when people edited the game, but its a lot of speculation that Gaster and Sans worked together on some kinda machine at one point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to give it back to the snowman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a way to get back to Edward Snowden from the last save point? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to the room that is south from Napstablooks house the one with the save point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Undynes house is in the North-west exit from there. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like a giant fish. #$%
@#$ $#@ The key lets you get some background info on Mettaton. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to her house if you haven't, it's east of Nappablook's house in Waterfalls, after doing that segment, you should eventually get a call from her asking to deliver a letter to Alphys, after that it's all pretty straightforward. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use a boat? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks goyims, I walked all the way through the game and even back to the door... #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually wait will i have to rebeat all of that, otherwise it loses its hype doesnt it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Got to do something to shirk Divequest. #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot furshit #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy your unnecessarily high monster encounter rate #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre pretty much done with TP, the only two optional things are some lore stuff for Mettaton and Sans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking autistchan #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright weaver, thats kinda cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know we have but it's still fucking awesome #$%
@#$ $#@ I really need to rewatch that movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ [INSERT "BAD TIME" MEME HERE] #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you, 5 years old? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to /co/ with all the other pedophiles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah Im good, thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve earned your bitter tears, now savor them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wish I hadnt lost my BN games during a move. #$%
@#$ $#@ 95% of the fight is him calling you out on your crimes, it wouldnt work. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could like accidently knock over his pet rock and have him do the same fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, hes way to chill to let something like that bother him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if you kill his brother hes cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ He only gives a shit when you kill everyone. #$%
@#$ $#@ probably SMT IV #$%
@#$ $#@ I just played earthbound for the first time recently, i really enjoyed. #$%
@#$ $#@ it was definitely a grind/a bit repetitive but it was charming and i really liked it, 8-9/10 imo #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how he still can't help fucking around with him #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this the one with the loli that is also somehow a pillow or something like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Was pretty cute honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ The way Sans looks up to Papyrus and the way Papyrus tries to order him around in doing chores makes me think that Papyrus is the older brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sans is kind of the slacker little brother who thinks the world of his hard-working, dim-witted brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always picture Sans as the "littler" brother anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think it matters whos older since theyre skeletons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only reason to do Genocide Ending is for Sans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also so you can do Soulless Pacifist and get a full idea of what a cunt Chara was. #$%
@#$ $#@ where the fuck was Frisks mom when they was wandering to the top of Mt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ebbot and falling into a giant hole #$%
@#$ $#@ Why was Frisk even there to begin with? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well yeah, its implied he can engage in time shenanigans and teleport, but thats kind of the skeletons shtick in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Papyrus and Sans appeared out of the blue in Snowdin one day, after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ IN MY WAY #$%
@#$ $#@ Just do it, dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ its fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can start all over again #$%
@#$ $#@ there's a difference between "wandered down the street" and "ended up on Suicide Mountain of No Return" #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course it doesnt really matter, I was just wondering for perspective on their relationship. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like I imagine their skeleton mom made Sans keep an eye on Papyrus whenever they went out together. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can barely remember the original of this but it fits so well #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool picture, but doesnt fit his character. #$%
@#$ $#@ He always believed in you and never tried to really kill you whether it be pacifist or genocide. #$%
@#$ $#@ He truly is the nicest character in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You only technically get Toriels and Papyruss, but Undyne shares his phone and youll get calls from other characters sometimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Capes are cool too though anon, they can be pretty flashy. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's intentionally ambiguous #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like to say Toriel is my favorite character but I fucking love terrible puns and Papyrus is just too damn likable. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's 10 dollars yo are you seriously that poor #$%
@#$ $#@ They're both fucking goofballs in TP though, it's great. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant make me choose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Chara #$%
@#$ $#@ God fucking damn it #$%
@#$ $#@ Try demo? #$%
@#$ $#@ * Ditch #$%
@#$ $#@ For Asgore, you have to hurt him, but talk to him until his attack and defense lower first. #$%
@#$ $#@ * Ditch #$%
@#$ $#@ Talk to him three times, and eat the pie from the beginning of the game #$%
@#$ $#@ The best I dunno, but definitely the most memorable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just pirate it if you think it isnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play it either way. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Finish it, before you get spoilered, you dumb fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to know who tells you to get up when you die. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make sure you get the soundtrack from somewhere because there's a bunch of songs you'll want to hear. #$%
@#$ $#@ keep playing, you can still get the true ending #$%
@#$ $#@ You fine bro, Flowey is just there to be a dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can fuck up REAL BAD but youd really have to try to do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is wrong with these people? #$%
@#$ $#@ God forbid someone roleplays in an RPG, no, better consult the internet as to whether or not Im going to win the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ to be fair, game devs have to try and aim their hints towards the most retarded player they can conceive of. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because competent gamers dont want to playtest, so they get people that do. #$%
@#$ $#@ This, I have a full time job, I cant sit and play a game just because. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were trying way too hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty entertaining. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why do you want to be a playtester? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dishonored especially made it clear in the levels before that if one thing dosent work, try another way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Possess a rat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Talk to people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill everyone in the room. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do something other than just give up. #$%
@#$ $#@ tfw retards are ruining this industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss when vidya was a niche hobby for nerds and didnt have any appeal for dumb normies. #$%
@#$ $#@ I felt like they would do it through other channels because of the onslaught of applicants thinking they're gonna have fun playing vidya and getting paid to do it #$%
@#$ $#@ They never hire people who are good or actually interested in finding out what they can with the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ They just take random shitters, stick them in a room with a controller and say "complete this". #$%
@#$ $#@ These people are mostly idiots, clearly. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is just plain wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont understand a section in a game, you can always look up guides or other sources for more information. #$%
@#$ $#@ A more apt comparison is if you didnt understand something and a movie and had to look up an analysis to understand it as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is an equivalent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise its like not understanding and just turning off the movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have an NPC explicitly tell you who the target is. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is with all these people comparing passive entertainment to active entertainment? #$%
@#$ $#@ The experience isnt the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be it reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing a game is an activity you do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like playing a sport, or any activity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its something you need to engage in to progress, so naturally its going to require some kind of investment on the players behalf. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of braindead motherfucker wouldn't think to do something different after maybe the first 2 times #$%
@#$ $#@ To save gaming from people who won't do 90 degree turns in games because that's too complex of level design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the same for gameplay depth and diversity though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing the game should be a reward, not just getting in-game money or stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, but at no point is someone incapable of playing the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you cant figure out where to go, theres fucking guides online and other means to find out. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thats not even saying the game is designed poorly, since there are many examples of people just being retarded as all hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that guy but I get to a point in a game were I have to essentially stop the game to figure out to progress instead of just progressing through actually playing the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe in exploration games like minecraft is this allowed but for standard RPGs and action games I dont want interruptions that just completely kills the pacing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not about sucking at playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its about the new "gamer" generation dont fucking use their brain. #$%
@#$ $#@ except thats bullshit,if enemies are tougher than you go somewhere else. #$%
@#$ $#@ A perfect example of this is dark souls,players can wander into new londo or the catacombs and get fucked up. #$%
@#$ $#@ 99% of players realize "hey guess I cant go here yet" and turn around, its just common sense,you'd have to be DSP level retarded to try to struggle through an area that's extremely difficult to go through. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, having a character who hasnt talked for two games only talk at the very end of one would be a bit confusing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kind of like that choice actually, the "silent character doesn't talk until the very end" thing doesn't quite sit right when it's the character you're playing as. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Silent character could actually talk the whole time" only works with SS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ And only because it added some levity to that steaming dump of an ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to agree that was a kinda shitty thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ That and how their vision thing to see the secret markings lasts like 3 seconds without upgrades. #$%
@#$ $#@ The whole level up system was pretty retarded for the most part. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the game has 20 or less hours of content, generally yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is Wizardry, Might and Magic, Kings Bounty, many, many, many console JRPGs.... #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh also gonna throw Ultima in there too because how could I forget. #$%
@#$ $#@ The exception to the rule. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre so fucking stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ All one has to do is go talk to the zombies blocking the path, then the woman appears near the hotel and you follow her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking kill yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, A MAJOR PART OF THE GAME IS INTERACTING WITH NPCS, YOU FUCKING MOUTHBREATHER. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet mostly its because of bad translations. #$%
@#$ $#@ This "exception" exists since the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually think Nintendo with its Super Guide in the new mario titles fucking solved the problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a shitty scrub? #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres someone playing the game for you to show you how its done, but you still need to execute the same stuff yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ If skill at videogames doesnt include understanding videogames and how to beat them, then what does? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is like someone asking people to stop writing books and just make pictures 'cause they don't want to learn to read. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ I applied for a play testing job a few years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had to do a test so they knew that I knew my shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to be able to convey whats going on in the game to the devs very clearly. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was actually a feature in Metroid: Other M #$%
@#$ $#@ its funny because i replayed the game and completed it in under 1 hour.. #$%
@#$ $#@ which isnt even a good time by speedrun standards #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy a prima stategy guide next time, friend! #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a real issue. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not just that players are reliant on them, it's that developers are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at Skyrim. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you can't spare five or ten minutes to figure something out then you probably shouldn't participate in a hobby where six hours is considered too short to even finish something in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the common man educated themselves outside of school things would be better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you actually think that happens? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not really the issue to be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the problem is more people think Games = Movies. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thus dont like to have to actually interact with the game in order to play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is kinda immensely stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they want to experience a game passively, theres tons of outlits for that these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ Demanding games be easier and more passive for them to enjoy is just the highest form of stupidity. #$%
@#$ $#@ gotta push common core somehow #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess video games became associated with passive entertainment like movies and stuff because you do both using a television. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its also why graphics and story/plot become so dominant in gaming because those are what stick out most in movies. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish this was bait... #$%
@#$ $#@ tell me this is fake, or written by a normie, even so, tell me it's fake #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if it is fake people like that still exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ why even live, knowing that you live in the same planet at these people #$%
@#$ $#@ To make the planet better. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you kill yourself the balance is just going to get worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ They apparently get them from the same pool of people in those infomercials. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to hold hands with Ougi-chan! #$%
@#$ $#@ Games needn't cost 200 million to make, then you don't have to appeal to a mass market. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking hate VNs getting lumped in with vidya if that counts for anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is a prank right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing more than a silly silly joke made by someone with a poor sense of humor? #$%
@#$ $#@ where do I apply? #$%
@#$ $#@ You didnt get the job BECAUSE you knew your shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont try to make excuses for retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ When you already went right twice and got the same results why would you do it a third time. #$%
@#$ $#@ great article tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont try to make excuses for retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ When you already went right twice and got the same results why would you do it a third time? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not just this "gamer" generation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its this generation of youth entirely. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very few of them have a sense of exploration and that brilliant spark of curiosity and that do are ostracized. #$%
@#$ $#@ We are nurturing a generation of gullible people. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, a lot of visual novels have game like elements to them, and even the ones that dont play similarly to Choose your own adventure stuff and have multiple choices that impact the path the story takes and the ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ i think its just like any technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont want to reinvent the wheel so you build on what others have created. #$%
@#$ $#@ This leads to screwups because you didnt design the software from the ground up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mind you, I dont hate VNs or even walking sims when done right, just think that they should have their own category or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like someone never played the Return to Cathedral mission in Thief Gold #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is this thread full of faggots defending retards? #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern games are piss easy as it. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you need to be walked through a modern game like a toddler, youre a fucking idiot and should probably find something new to do so games will stop being made so shit to accommodate your dumb ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus fuck, please kill me now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder that these imbeciles are what qualifies for playtesters nowadays. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe complex vidya isn't for you #$%
@#$ $#@ here he is guys, the master bait detection expert #$%

@#$ $#@ Whats an Apache? #$%
@#$ $#@ well op proved you wrong #$%
@#$ $#@ My name is mikecrotch. #$%

@#$ $#@ Fun fact, twenty minutes after this photo was taken John dragged yoko back into his apartment and beat the chicken shit out of her #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, ill have to check that out but ill never forgive him for that phase and ill never forgive him for validating and releasing the cancer on the music/art industry that is Yoko Ono. #$%
@#$ $#@ So like he did every day? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is it about this picture thats so surreal and creepy? #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear there is a better walk #$%
@#$ $#@ he looks weird because its something cartoons do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lennonbob stop, its creepy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Harrison was pretty talented #$%
@#$ $#@ Good lord that looks disturbing. #$%
@#$ $#@ God I miss that show. #$%

@#$ $#@ Everything about that walk cycle screams /x/. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Beatles: Rock Band #$%
@#$ $#@ You just posted it, buddy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best way is to play the PSP version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or the PSone version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neither game is made easier in the gba version, stop being retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you really want someone to play the pain in the ass versions? #$%
@#$ $#@ the bonus dungeons in I based on III-VI are fun #$%
@#$ $#@ this exact version is also on mobile #$%
@#$ $#@ PSP version is the best but make sure you play the digital version to avoid loading #$%
@#$ $#@ The PSP version is god-like compared to the shit they called FFV on Steam. #$%
@#$ $#@ people only shit on it because they haven't played it and think it's like the mobile versions of FFV and VI #$%
@#$ $#@ FFV sprites on steam would look better if they werent so bright. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its only the tiling that sticks out like sore thumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ V and VI are worse, but this is almost as bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, those are the FF5 and FF6 remakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ And while were on the topic, stop bitching and begging for another set of remakes for those games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its FFIII though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beehive from her original design was better. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also reminded me of The Jetsons, which I like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut the fuck up. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound just like that butthurt daisyfag who makes constant shitposts. #$%

@#$ $#@ my boss just called me into his office! #$%
@#$ $#@ How is this game related #$%
@#$ $#@ BLACKED.com is the hot new /v/ meme #$%
@#$ $#@ why is this shit pouring from pol and tv. #$%
@#$ $#@ And why mods not delete this shit instantly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cuckolding was a great fetish until it was saturated by niggers #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what, that really is a damn shame, she would be beautiful, and now she's ruined forever #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, scratch that, 14.75 is only a 1% increase over 14.45 #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would they crack down on that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Porn on a blue board is against the rules, what memes people throw around isnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ it triggers me asshole #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because you saw it on /v/ posted by a spammer every single night means its the hottest trend in the porn industry? #$%
@#$ $#@ Money and intelligence. #$%
@#$ $#@ STOP FUCKING TRIGGERING ME #$%
@#$ $#@ At least post some more superior blonde girls you nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Too skinny. #$%

@#$ $#@ My nigga #$%

@#$ $#@ I fucking love this guy, the autism is just as real as the satire imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ that being said, I like BillyMC more, he's pure and innocent whereas this guy is just le funny autistic man #$%
@#$ $#@ ChipCheezumLPs and AccursedFarms are the only game channels I really follow. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lots of semi-vidya stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ He isnt a lets player, he just makes video game videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ One or two series doesnt make him one. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's the cat planet guy right #$%
@#$ $#@ Finally, someone else who understands #$%
@#$ $#@ read the OP, retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ LPing has nothing to do with this thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ So did they do all the ambition games or is there still some bastion of insanity that I havent seen? #$%
@#$ $#@ They finally found a boring game to drown out, just play one game forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ to me, being good at games makes a good streamer but not a good youtuber. #$%
@#$ $#@ i could just play the game myself if i wanted to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Star doesn't even make videos any more, he's tired of TF2 and is perpetually moving #$%
@#$ $#@ hes good without TF2. #$%
@#$ $#@ i still love that food genius video. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean MechaGameZilla? #$%
@#$ $#@ There was a countdown here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its gone now. #$%
@#$ $#@ retsupurea havent done anything good in close to a decade. #$%
@#$ $#@ best husbando #$%
@#$ $#@ the only sonic 06 LP worth watching is the pokecapn one #$%
@#$ $#@ Diabetus still manages to be funny at times, so I wouldn't say that Retsupurae is the worst channel #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't the pokemon RP video come out after that #$%
@#$ $#@ Superjeenius is pretty good. #$%
@#$ $#@ His Persona LPs are very detailed. #$%
@#$ $#@ hi Jake #$%

@#$ $#@ Bait of the worst kind. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good taste here. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're bait #$%
@#$ $#@ Im enjoying him playing this falafel game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Always refreshing when he isnt just playing Mario hacks. #$%
@#$ $#@ LGRs retro computer stuff is arguably better than his retro vidya stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tech Tales and his Oddware series are informative and entertaining. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny how you picked the one that children are fixated on the most. #$%
@#$ $#@ Retsupurae actually lay down jokes that arent rape, dick, and shit jokes. #$%
@#$ $#@ all cr1t does is curse. #$%
@#$ $#@ maybe if i was in 6th grade and it was new to me i would like him #$%
@#$ $#@ Dunkey hasnt been funny for over a year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes also a whiny bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ LoLfaggot pls. #$%
@#$ $#@ The count really let himself go. #$%
@#$ $#@ the pokecapn sonic 06 lp is basically high art, it's the Dante's Inferno of LPs. #$%
@#$ $#@ they were making fun of him the exact same way they made fun of all the other guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ go to bed, pewdiepie #$%
@#$ $#@ And the Retsucuck fanboys still think Retsupurae is funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slowbeef could make a ten minute video of him doing the shitty Ridley voice and theyd eat it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the difference? #$%
@#$ $#@ You really are retarded, arent you? #$%
@#$ $#@ STAR is better then Jerma. #$%

@#$ $#@ in regular mood i wouldnt aprove any of both, need to get like extremly horny to ever think of doing any of both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you ever actually done either? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just personally do not see the appeal in sucking dick because theres not much of a flavor or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its hot and all, but most guys Ive been with prefer just fucking me to getting their dick sucked and it feels better for both parties, so I dont see much of a reason to want to suck dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ no, i havent do neither. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a tranny faggot, im more attracted to girls, but sometimes when im really turned on i feel more sexually attracted to guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, well just keep in mind it's not all it's cracked up to me, at least in my opinion. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can get behind you with that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a sissy girly boy and Ive got a small dick and I love when my partners is significantly larger than mine and they rub it against mine, it feels emasculating and great. #$%

@#$ $#@ Nah man, traps erryday. #$%

@#$ $#@ Im always moving up difficulties to get better, so I never really get chances to Perfect any songs. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only song Ive perfected is Last Night Good Night, one of the easier songs on Extreme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only went that low in difficulty just because I was feeling a little down that day. #$%

@#$ $#@ I want to eat takoyaki with Luka! #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, like I said, I should really name these files. #$%
@#$ $#@ It might help #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually tried to do that for Romeo and Cinderella, but its just a huge pain the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just completed the intro and then stopped. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit I did not see that kiss while I was playing #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, Maybe? #$%

@#$ $#@ why are some Youtube uploads so terrible quality... #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably because people rip them from NND at low quality and then reupload them to Youtube. #$%

@#$ $#@ Is this the same as Tetsuwan Birdy Decode? #$%
@#$ $#@ I torrented that shit ages ago and never watched it. #$%
@#$ $#@ These webms look fucking dope. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will watch half the series tonight if theyre the same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ it'd be like making an entire game revolving around Runescape's Grand Exchange, then mixing in some weird Pagan subplot #$%
@#$ $#@ That is some of the laziest animation I have ever seen, holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont understand how badly I want this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive never actually seen it be properly discussed. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I ever see is shitposters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want it to be in the style of Coropata #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably because shes not human? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its getting a dating sin. #$%
@#$ $#@ There arent even Japanese BDs for Birdy. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a wicked world with little good in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Watch it immediately. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt the problem with anime games that theyre so story based already that theres no wiggle room for actual gameplay? #$%
@#$ $#@ shittiest anime ever #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did the Gantz anime have suck so hard? #$%
@#$ $#@ OVA Birdy &gt;&gt;&gt; TV Birdy #$%
@#$ $#@ that shit will get a VN at best #$%
@#$ $#@ Id play a Birdy game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wonder how the gameplay would go. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's because that shit is sadly getting a game #$%
@#$ $#@ it'd only work as a vn, unless you're talking about some kind of bullet-hell/never stop dodging until you get that one hit in kind of game #$%
@#$ $#@ Characters like that just arent interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like in games when characters go from 1dps to 9,000,000,000dps, its no longer impressive and cool, its just boring and tired. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you have some mopey indie game to play? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want an Im@s game with puchim@s #$%
@#$ $#@ Crap, cant find a good place to download em. #$%
@#$ $#@ what game? #$%
@#$ $#@ We could try a hack n slash rpg sort of deal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where you make your own hero and try and rise up the ranks of the hero association. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those are from the 2008-2009 Birdy, but 90s Birdy is great, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only one of them is. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other is 90s. #$%
@#$ $#@ I quoted both because I was comparing them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all actions games are mosou games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Birdy isn't about fighting waves of grunts, it's mostly about sci-fi mystery solving and boss fights against single powerful opponents. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill settle for those for now, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ there was one the ps1 that was fun #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds cool. #$%

@#$ $#@ COLLARBONES EVERYWHEREEEEE #$%
@#$ $#@ Samurai Flamenco #$%
@#$ $#@ Infamous should have just been Japanese Electric Batman: The Game. #$%
@#$ $#@ That outfit is really dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gays not welcome. #$%

@#$ $#@ Stop talking to yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wheres the blonde one from? #$%

@#$ $#@ Manga, 1st movie, ???, Stand Alone Complex, 2nd movie, 2nd GiG and Arise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bugs me now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Decode a shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should have just continued the OVA. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dorohedoro is vastly underrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always imagined it working as a No More Heroes like game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Depp is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wouldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has a biological forcefield, her uniform is supposed to look like a sci-fi gymnastics leotard. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks good in motion, and indirectly indicates her acrobatic skillset. #$%
@#$ $#@ While cool, I don't know if Hei could pull off the same variety of electric powers to fill out Cole's moveset. #$%
@#$ $#@ Infamous always made me think of Sparky Pikachu instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres an FPS arena shooter online game out in japan or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ idk the details but Ive seen a few threads on it on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be one of his minions going out on missions would be cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eventually you get stronger and Momo notices you and brings you on as his favorite servant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Overlord, an anime about a necromancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably the best anime of the decade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only manly anime since Gurren Lagann. #$%
@#$ $#@ who the meme fuck is balsa? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Morito any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw the first episode and it seemed kinda gay #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the CoD clone he mentioned. #$%
@#$ $#@ it looks 90% more fluid than half of the shit /a/ talks about, ESPECIALLY any moe shit at their most climactic scenes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I being trolled? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a dynamic, aesthetically-pleasing design that looks good animated. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt need to be realistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quality isnt binary, genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something could be better than something awful but still not be good. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is the pace of updates for this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent read it in a year. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's meh, but I watched it basically just for the fights #$%
@#$ $#@ Man-Machine Interface, the 2nd manga. #$%
@#$ $#@ Markovich is superior. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's about monthly at this point #$%
@#$ $#@ Honest to death question here. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck do you start this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ They keep making movies and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know what it is about but it looks serious as shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitch please, Bathhouse Owner is infinitely better than Markovich and Jack. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont listen to them, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm with you and I don't even watch that stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ But now I want to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Start with the 95 movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then watch stand alone complex. #$%
@#$ $#@ The quick way would be to start with the first movie, and if you like that you can invest the time into watching SAC and go from there. #$%
@#$ $#@ never seen this, what is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Meow is cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, most people seem to like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I like about Birdy's powerset. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes a superhuman brawler, but not to the point that it becomes a powerlevel contest. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I thought as well and I haven't even played the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could see where they would be getting at if they tried to copy Rainbow 6: Siege, but even then it just doesnt feel right in my opinion. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't help that I don't like cod clones either too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had forgotten that vampire hunter D existed. #$%
@#$ $#@ My young self enjoyed that anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have a movie there, movies arent anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ and gunbuster is pretty much a movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd fuck with that #$%
@#$ $#@ Sora no Woto is looking awfully K-on! #$%
@#$ $#@ I was trying to decide what I would prefer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was thinking like more along the lines of Spider-Man 2 where, yeah there is an open world kinda but theres really nothing to do outsides of the missions within it, which are pretty linear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you for the Sky High pictures anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ the difference is that one piece is actually good #$%
@#$ $#@ This, this thread is filled with narutofags. #$%
@#$ $#@ Birdy is a guy right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, he is in charge of the program. #$%
@#$ $#@ I should probably watch it one day. #$%
@#$ $#@ I knew it was slice-of-life, but I didnt know the art was so cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is she or is she not wearing underwear? #$%
@#$ $#@ they did a series of shorts a few years ago and an anime is planned for 2016 #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, I'm hyped #$%
@#$ $#@ Wheres a good place to watch the Lupin movies? #$%
@#$ $#@ is that anime even good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I read the manga but I dropped it when I realized the protagonist can literally one punch any enemy to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno man, Ive watched whatever is available on nyaa. #$%
@#$ $#@ Birdy is 100% female, but can switch places with a boy name Tsutomu thanks to ayy lmao science. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats the joke, the struggle is mostly his companions and side characters #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything, Licenceless Rider is the hidden MC of the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not soon enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ i hate dumbasses like you who whine about improper clothing even though you know why it looks the way it does. #$%
@#$ $#@ this show gave me such a boner #$%
@#$ $#@ i can imagine the fucky ass soundtrack and a weapon upgrade menu/shop #$%
@#$ $#@ In my /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ this´d either be very short or they would make more game-only adventures inbetween, either way it´d be a blast, i bet the ost would be pretty creepy #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like the eva whore #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it is #$%
@#$ $#@ kek what have they done to their own IP #$%
@#$ $#@ made a sequel #$%
@#$ $#@ You are very wrong, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ dammit kaiman, stop making me want gyozas, we don´t have those here #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it literally doesnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise we would have it right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're so yummy anon #$%
@#$ $#@ man the adaptations his work have got are great as serious as they are, but i still really want a proper adaptation of shirow´s style with the cool stories with lighthearted and funny characters, a tank police or appleseed game would be tits #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you for introducing me to this incredibly comfy manga #$%
@#$ $#@ I know it really pisses some people off but I think a KLK game by platinum would be a solid iodea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because anime is video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off retard #$%
@#$ $#@ This and this #$%
@#$ $#@ I want a not-gundam mecha game, but for that to exist there would have to be a good not-gundam mecha anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look three posts up, somebody beat you to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even frozen ones? #$%
@#$ $#@ not him but i only watched the weird live action one #$%
@#$ $#@ Kanno didnt do the old OVA, that was Kou Otani. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, I was talking about Decode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regardless of what it is, it would make a fine vidya game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, I meant Kamiya #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, it's a common joke, but boobs ACTUALLY don't work that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im aware of how ridiculous its done, but Ive never noticed her nipple literally move up to her shoulder before. #$%
@#$ $#@ the comic was already bad, at least the anime made things a bit more interesting but gonzo is still gonzo #$%
@#$ $#@ Crowds was dialogue-heavy enough to work as a VN. #$%
@#$ $#@ Katze-san shut upssu #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like to see and Index game with the entirety of Academy City to play around in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being able to design your own esper and choose your own power would be cool too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Throughout the game you could advance in level until you end up being a totally op awakened level 5 like pic related. #$%
@#$ $#@ This would be brilliant. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never realized how depressing it is to realize this would never happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ because you didn't watch the shitty ones #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Sins, but the classic needs love. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a shitty mobile thingy already. #$%
@#$ $#@ a shitty mobage isnt good enough, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Two things. #$%
@#$ $#@ One, the crap is filtered out over the years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody remembers the chaff of the 80's and 90's. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other is that the high points were generally a lot higher. #$%
@#$ $#@ The industry had more people in it making anime for animes sake than today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine trying to get this greenlit today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd have a dozen executives jump on you and the protagonist would be switched to an autistic 15 year old boy before you hit the ground. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same goes for vidya and western cinema. #$%
@#$ $#@ Iria inspired me to draw women. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chaika on the FOB. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes an acrobat. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has electrical powers. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has body-switching and a robot octopus as a buddy-cop. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a lot to work with. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would just be God Hand with boobs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm okay with this #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre thinking of K, or K-Project. #$%
@#$ $#@ It got a movie and a new season's airing right now and it actually wasn't all that bad, now that I think about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ God Hand + Gravity Rush + Mirrors Edge + Devil May Cry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mellowlink is pretty cool #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats with that fucking face? #$%
@#$ $#@ Genetic perfection. #$%
@#$ $#@ Space elf genetics. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn it, why did I find this hilarious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last season was pretty shitty but try Log Horizon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like Sword Art Online, but not shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell it's creator even visted /a/ multiple times, he's a bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ DUDE WEED LMAO #$%
@#$ $#@ You know a lot about science, but you dont know how good a cigarette tastes in the morning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you care? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre white. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it any worse than nanomachines injected with a literal virus and that get stuck in your body and cause ill effects in elderly aged people? #$%
@#$ $#@ This dialogue made me want to smoke again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you Kojimbo, and fuck you too Fukushima, I know you were behind the codecs too. #$%
@#$ $#@ We fuck like 15 years from now. #$%
@#$ $#@ It does when youre addicted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the real money maker in the industry is the expensive cancer treatments, dumb goy. #$%
@#$ $#@ So why dont they just make cigarettes without the benzoshizzile? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because he chose to live to the fullest, and he realized that the smokes were really fucking up his lungs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quit smoking for 2 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that sensation so well I can taste and smell it right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ kill yourselves you fucking degenerates #$%
@#$ $#@ shut up pol #$%
@#$ $#@ Potentially higher chance of cancer. #$%
@#$ $#@ They havent been out long enough for us to know long term effects. #$%
@#$ $#@ MG2 implies Lucky Strike and Pall Mall #$%
@#$ $#@ You are the one dying from cancer, you ho #$%
@#$ $#@ A cigarette in the morning with a freshly brewed cup of coffee is the #1 reason I took so long to quit. #$%
@#$ $#@ to look edgy or fashionable #$%
@#$ $#@ Regurgitated them. #$%
@#$ $#@ The shots he'd got before the mission temporarily neutralized his stomach acid #$%
@#$ $#@ Difference between being flawed and being retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried #$%
@#$ $#@ Companies, money, and corruption. #$%
@#$ $#@ The world's fucked up fam #$%
@#$ $#@ why even bother posting this #$%
@#$ $#@ It's based on REX concept art so it's only natural it's a top tier Metal Gear design #$%
@#$ $#@ Felt like it fam #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont smoke at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bullshit, source or gtfo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if true, maybe people shouldn't walk through other people's smoke. #$%
@#$ $#@ best girl and good choice #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks doc #$%
@#$ $#@ You can obviously see motherfuckers smoking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its their own fault if they get second-hand smoke. #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant to just use the regular one, but oh well #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS4 showed that there are multiple ways to relieve stress besides smoking. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can smell herbs, lye down in the shade, sit in a box, read a playboy, listen to music, drink a cola or eat some noodles. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you need more stress relief than your daily jerk off provides, youre a pussy, anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smokers are the most weak willed faggots imaginable. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt fucking say that, you lying piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Y-yeah bro, I-I can totally relate to that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wanted to die, but too afraid to commit suicide #$%
@#$ $#@ i guess merry gear solid 2 if you're desperate #$%
@#$ $#@ Stress is self generated. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have to feel it if don't make it. #$%
@#$ $#@ p53 m8 shoulda gone speck savers #$%
@#$ $#@ Video games make you anti social and you still play them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you all faggots denying your nature, then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats only true to a certain extent. #$%
@#$ $#@ If shit's really fucked up, you can't really stop it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It still makes you cough like a motherfucker and fucks with your lungs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ It took me a while to realize I had anxiety problems. #$%
@#$ $#@ One day in class I just had a panic attack seemingly out of nowhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt realize I was stressing out until it hit me in the face. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh please. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I don't care if you believe me but I'm taking Xanax now but only when I absolutely need it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grad school isnt a walk in the park anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im glad weed killed your parents, scumbag. #$%
@#$ $#@ I do what I enjoy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you live in a bubble? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you frantically avoid anything that could pose a potential threat to the longevity of your life and justify it with that retarded comparison every time? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm still mad that she wasn't arrested and killed because of that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Naomi, shes always been a cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but Ive tried cigs a few times and never understood what the big deal was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt feel anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if smokers like e-cigs? #$%
@#$ $#@ That seems to be more acceptable nowadays. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know who people like less? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if you dont smoke they are the most annoying cunts in the world. #$%
@#$ $#@ By the way Otacon! #$%
@#$ $#@ How come your dad made better Metal Gears than yours back in the 70s and 80s? #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems to me that you either love them, or you hate them. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what it's been like in my experience anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ There arent really that many 2D stealth action games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe the NES Metal Gears and the Boktai series if youre desperate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eating beef jerky makes me feel manly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like teriyaki style. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its all about how you feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ What other people think doesnt matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ RAKI TAKI TERIYAKI TERIYAKI TASTE LIKE SAKE #$%
@#$ $#@ Except smoking is done just to fit in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to eat homemade ramen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to say this is true for the majority of smokers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most smokers start at a young age and they get influenced. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once you in your mid twenties the tobacco companies cant hope to get you to start smoking - the window is gone. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS1 was pretty much the MSX Metal Gears remade in polygon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too many poetry moments. #$%
@#$ $#@ It worked until Vic Boss and Venom Snake destroyed them. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh nvm now i remember #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh Christ why #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck that though, first cigarette of day is the hardest for me I cant even walk right after it for some reason way too intense. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe if youre a pussy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its disrespectful. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one would be sperging if the drawing was next to Spike, but damn right dab in the center of him in permanent marker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its almost as if the person was trying to make a point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats been there awhile, he could have found somewhere else to draw cmon #$%
@#$ $#@ I was. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt do it for a long time because I would keep having cough fits the next day and I could feel that shit in my throat and lungs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoyed doing it but the after effects were too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldnt consciously do that do my body knowing the aftermath. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ttry to do something like the original sketch then, I bet you wont even be able to do a decent stickman. #$%
@#$ $#@ People in ye olden days smelled like shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tobacco smells slightly worse, and also dulls your sense of smell. #$%
@#$ $#@ That plus addictive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it smells good personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ I almost feel like its the same guy, just trying to start shit with everyone in the thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes hoping, praying someone will get in a full on argument with him. #$%
@#$ $#@ It always smells good to me too when someone else is smoking. #$%
@#$ $#@ When I on a occasion I do smoke all I can think is get this damn smell off my fingers and beard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want this in my house damn it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then I wind up changing all my cloths, taking a shower, and brushing my teeth. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wish it would smell better like dark shag tobacco or those cedar dunhill internationals. #$%
@#$ $#@ You him? #$%
@#$ $#@ It smells "unique" imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not good or bad, but you instantly know what that smell is. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats why I only vape or mix it with shisha in a hooka. #$%
@#$ $#@ That lingering smell is fucking worst. #$%
@#$ $#@ I suppose thats why they call it dank cause it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its either smoking or drinking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill quit when I have the money to spend on the copious amounts of alcohol I need to stave off my inevitable suicide. #$%
@#$ $#@ he said long hair #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, Id ask if you are me but thats the reason I havent quit yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you future me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do things get better? #$%
@#$ $#@ Life sucks then you die. #$%
@#$ $#@ About what I was expecting though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Weed smells like skunk, shits gross #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does no one in mgs1 have any eyes? #$%
@#$ $#@ yes its enjoyable if you take it at face value. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can actually use a lot of the unique characters you capture or rescue and a few of them have unique items. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like Null grey fox and his machete and Cunningham and his laser cannon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a real cute game the maps are smallish but they have a very mgs3 soviet base feel to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Controls are essentially mgs but with sneak button. #$%
@#$ $#@ you hold triangle to sneak instead of trying to half tilt the psp's analog nub #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt the game mostly hurt by a lack of pacing due to the constant changing of characters and the capture points? #$%
@#$ $#@ no that's only when you're "harvesting". #$%
@#$ $#@ Switching soldiers is actually kind cool like say you can move them to different points in the map and really pull the enemies forces apart and make an opening some of the more difficult areas. #$%
@#$ $#@ But if I remember correctly they all start in the same place but I think you can order them to different locations. #$%
@#$ $#@ For the most part you can ignore it though for the campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its one those features you can master to your ridiculous advantage or ignore it and be a purist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like I made the right choice by smoking. #$%
@#$ $#@ I forgot to mention like the earlier mgs's there's little vents, cosmetic shacks and shit like that everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a lot of little items tucked away in cozy hiding places. #$%
@#$ $#@ The maps also have lots of points of entry and stuff so theyre really nice to explore and learn their secrets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kids do it to look cool, then get addicted and carry on doing it through life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Asthma probably #$%
@#$ $#@ everyone wants to rebel in some way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cigarette companies knew this and funded stuff like the tobacco is wacko campaign, truth and similar anti-smoking advertisements. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were counting on people not doing what was forced down their throats. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one plans on getting addicted everyone thinks theyll quit in like a year or so before they become too hooked but it never works like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Perdomos are the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ But OP, P53 has [/spoiler]NO GENES[/spoiler] #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to start smoking cigars soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if it'd be better to start with cigarillos. #$%
@#$ $#@ I aint going back there, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant make me. #$%
@#$ $#@ just make it a 'yes' or 'no' poll you stupid faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ get saged moron. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would literally in the most literal sense be an advertising board. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt this is real, but it will be nice to see this board without kids talking about their youtubers and anita twitters #$%
@#$ $#@ /r9k/ - Mental Health Disorders should be deleted. #$%
@#$ $#@ "containment boards" are a myth #$%
@#$ $#@ /vg/ being merged back into /v/ would bring back the severe circle jerk trip threads that pretend to talk about video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off newshit with your useless opinion.Otherwise youd know that /r9k/ was deleted and they flooded other boards. #$%
@#$ $#@ that is your fault for liking western games #$%
@#$ $#@ it shouldve stayed deleted. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's better for garbage to be slowly moderated out in other boards than to give it a home #$%
@#$ $#@ /eceleb/ doesnt exist for exactly that reason - it would be a stealth /gg/ board. #$%
@#$ $#@ twitter/kotaku/youtube garbage should be banned, take that garbage to cripplechan or reddit #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself please #$%
@#$ $#@ Years ago we werent filled with people crying over trannies and armenian whores. #$%
@#$ $#@ i do remember, mods should've done their fucking job and cracked down on it #$%
@#$ $#@ This sounds like a better idea each time someones says it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing of value would be lost. #$%
@#$ $#@ they can go to a different website #$%
@#$ $#@ you two make a good point. #$%
@#$ $#@ we need another optionhire more janitors to nuke e-celeb threads the minute they're created #$%
@#$ $#@ Bring back the world filter. #$%
@#$ $#@ difference in content now, its not people crying over somebody being a 'sjw' on twitter as opposed to actually talking about a youtuber or somebody who posted something video game related on twitter #$%
@#$ $#@ Technically, thats everyone who draws a pulse, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ /vr/ was made because /v/ is absolute shit and people who played retro games needed a board that wasn't filled with 13 year olds #$%
@#$ $#@ Society needs more segregation in general imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apartheid worked. #$%
@#$ $#@ now fuck off #$%
@#$ $#@ Well this thread is /b/ tier so youve already got your utopia, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ people are confusing a thread about a youtuber/streamer/live event with Brianna Wu or somebody like her crying on twitter #$%
@#$ $#@ The "culture" part of the rules is abused for this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ No other board has it and they function perfectly fine, but these e-celeb cucks know its not video games, so they cling to the only thing they think it makes them relevant. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think comparing segregating interests on an anonymous image board made for weeaboos and transitive genocide is a slight stretch. #$%
@#$ $#@ sjw and cuck should both be filtered #$%
@#$ $#@ Exactly so if you dont want to see that you can just not go there. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am ignorant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt apartheit just generic racism? #$%
@#$ $#@ How did it work, what did it achieve? #$%
@#$ $#@ literally google apartheid and click on the first result #$%
@#$ $#@ Circlejerking about the latest e-celeb gossip and what someone mightve said on twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Put the goalposts down faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ nobody gives a shit about gamer goob anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ Why didnt you also screencap the part where he wants boards to discuss what they want? #$%
@#$ $#@ arguing semantics is a great way to prove yourself right! #$%
@#$ $#@ another compelling reason for it to not be allowed. #$%
@#$ $#@ would you have supported a chanology board in 2011? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because youre not the only faggot using this site or board. #$%
@#$ $#@ If things don't interest you ignore them they don't fucking affect you at all, besides you having to either scroll past them or fucking click the hide thread button. #$%
@#$ $#@ You clearly dont remember the massive spam and shitstorms it created just by posting a silhouette of a pony. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nishimura doesn't run 2chan anymore, and he hasn't for a long time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if there is a board for it, that wont stop people from posting that shit here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just crack down on banning it. #$%
@#$ $#@ honestly just ban everything that isnt memes from /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Talking about a person who happens to play video games is not video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ We dont need to make threads about people just because they played a video game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen like a million Two Best Friends threads being made because the OP thought someone played the game wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is not thread material. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its /b/ shit at best. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even understand this insult. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont partake in e-celeb threads, but bitching about them and not the constantly prevalent generals or floods of redundant threads is retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, if anything, we need a Nintendo quarantine board more than anything else, those guys go apeshit about their games and it drowns out everything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ because MLP shit was in every thread in every board shitting up everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ a few threads about some twitter or youtube thing aren't like that at all and they don't disturb any other thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ People arent going into fucking [INSERT GAME NAME] thread and randomly starting to talk about ecelebs. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're in for a ride, aren't we? #$%
@#$ $#@ You appears when someone quotes your post. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's an accusation that you're fishing for replies #$%
@#$ $#@ I knew the first bit, but didnt realize the second. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you babbling about now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes I'm just in the mood to discuss something else, and I don't want the entire board filled with the same topic. #$%
@#$ $#@ We dont need 15 Splatoon threads two weeks after it was released. #$%
@#$ $#@ We dont need the entire board to be filled with RIP Iwata threads or Holy shit Smash news threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ aa2 is more vidya than what wu-wear has to say #$%
@#$ $#@ How about we create the eceleb board, let it run for a while like about 6 months, then perma-ban everyone in it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its what I would do. #$%
@#$ $#@ /pol/ was nuked? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also /ckd/ for kickstarter/early access fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do what the Escapist did and make a game industry board for celebs and drama. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every E celeb thread created deletes a different thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ How many good vidya threads have been culled because some retards just had to talk about their fucking pretend friends on giant bomb or super best friends or whatever the fuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id wager a fair number. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, all fanbases go apeshit at times. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what would make more sense? #$%
@#$ $#@ a thread on /vg/ #$%
@#$ $#@ The e-celeb shit hasnt gone away for almost 4 years now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its only gained traction. #$%
@#$ $#@ The last time I heard anything about NMA was when FONV came out and their general consensus was "eh, its okay, at least its not fallout 3." #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly thought they had died off like world of gothics english boards and a bunch of other niche rpg sites. #$%
@#$ $#@ so clearly threads on page 1 at the top are great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Before Luggage Lad left one of his last acts was to turn /pol/ into a mess of shitposts after they made one too many cuck jokes about him. #$%
@#$ $#@ He left it like that for weeks. #$%
@#$ $#@ That image kinda feels like the frontpage of /v/ doesnt it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Where are the xbox fans? #$%
@#$ $#@ Eceleb and waifufaggotry, to capture the worst of /tv/ and /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the really good threads on /v/ tend to be slower moving so actual discussion can happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ As such they tend to fall back into the other pages, and occasionally they do end up on page 10 and are saved at the last minute by a bump. #$%
@#$ $#@ What, do you only come here for LOL threads and twitter bullshit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those aren't "good threads", they're memespam retardation. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like you haven't even read the content of the thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ they belong in /b/, really #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't care, it's a video game, deal with it nerd. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were fine until some faggot started making threads all over /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no opinion here, just fact. #$%
@#$ $#@ The advantage of more splits is that /v/ slows down, so discussion that doesn't move at 5 posts a minute is possible and doesn't get pushed off instantly, and it's also easier to moderate, since it's more clear-cut what belongs where #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont consider /b/ to be 4chan anymore, I want nothing to do with those people. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want to make a thread about fucking ANYTHING on that board. #$%
@#$ $#@ That board is not for discussion about anything, its a porn board for 14 year olds whove newly discovered 4chan and dont know what to do with their new found freedom. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like uni freshmen that get drunk and high and skip classes and flunk out. #$%
@#$ $#@ They need to become civilized before moving to another board. #$%
@#$ $#@ A game dev is not an eceleb, stop being a faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you enter that... #$%
@#$ $#@ You just want collisions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve really never seen that before? #$%
@#$ $#@ You must not live near many highways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look up a phenomenon called Gaper's block; in my traffic engineering courses we cover that shit like it's fucking rocket science #$%
@#$ $#@ Got you covered fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone else get an issue where the 3x speed doesnt actually go 3x? #$%
@#$ $#@ It just sort of chugs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time I start a new city, I play for a few hours, get sick of fucking with traffic, and quit without saving. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I have done at least 5 cities this way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Treatment plants and garbage burners. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that colonial charter? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont remember it looking so good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck that is comfy #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like Banished #$%
@#$ $#@ I long for the day when the roads are almost entirely filled with autonomous cars that can avoid and cooperatively iron out shockwaves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post winter shots #$%
@#$ $#@ How drastically different from vanilla is whatever update theyre running at? #$%
@#$ $#@ If it's just expanded production chains for the sake of expanding production trains, I'll probably stick with Fountain Mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ nice man thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ Try SimCity 4 with money tree, you dont have to worry about the economic aspects, and SC4 has pretty easy AI in terms of their demand to expand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Banished with the Colonial Charter mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant comment on the mod itself, but vanilla is a pretty unique city sim emphasis on the sim. #$%
@#$ $#@ You start out with a group of banished people and either a few houses, crops, and a barn, or nothing but a wagon and basic supplies. #$%
@#$ $#@ From there, you hunt game, gather berries and herbs, chop down trees, mine, and trade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youll eventually start setting up fields, dealing with immigrants and disease, battling fires and pestilence, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Solid game thatll keep you sated for a good 20-30 hours at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Way more if it really clicks and you get into the modding scene. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gotta finish my work first before I can pop back in for new screen shots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I might just make a new town to get comfy with or try Adam and Eve difficulty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt there a recent traffic jam in China that was stuck for a week? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was hoping for some more in-depth econ. #$%
@#$ $#@ sim where you have to deal with different social classes and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Certain industries require management by wealthy, educated people, who in turn require certain goods and infrastructure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Crime would also be a nice addition. #$%
@#$ $#@ As a computer engineer who works with online devices for a lot of different companies, I will absolutely refuse to buy a car that connects to the internet until car companies start actually putting decent security measures in place. #$%
@#$ $#@ A lot of cars with "smart" information/entertainment systems available today have extremely basic, gaping security holes that could be fixed if the car companies would just give a damn. #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead, they just try to ignore the problem and threaten to sue security researchers who find these problems in order to prevent them from releasing their findings. #$%
@#$ $#@ Security by obscurity is not any security at all, how the fuck are there people in the year 2015 that still havent figured this out. #$%
@#$ $#@ From my experience, i found that SimCity 4 being easier to get into compared to Cities Skylines. #$%
@#$ $#@ I imagine by the time these cars are actually meant to be sold there will be a better dynamic available in terms of security. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre trying to reinvent a supercomputer system so that everything is pure free flow at all times regardless of what the driver wants out of the car. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its crazy, the goal is to save gas. #$%
@#$ $#@ The population needed for that to matter makes the game rather silly anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ It defeats the premise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fair enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, I cant help but be a bit underwhelmed at this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Adding something as simple conceptually, at least as currency and wages would tremendously increase the depth of Banisheds socioeconomic simulation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somewhat shallow though. #$%
@#$ $#@ More of a survival sim than a city builder. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont see a correlation between knowingly lying to their customers about one thing and knowingly lying to their customers about another? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats that starry void beyond the mountains? #$%
@#$ $#@ Goddamn, this village just oozes personality. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could actually see myself living here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Great job. #$%
@#$ $#@ Starry sky mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just like 4 images for different zooms. #$%
@#$ $#@ The place you throw the citys garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of traffic stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of it is unlocked as your city grows but other stuff will require mods #$%
@#$ $#@ like any traffic stuff, I don't see a management tab or have any congestion stuff popping up, I've just been doing one-lane roads and everything seems to be fine #$%
@#$ $#@ On the upper left corner there should be a button with different overviews you can choose from. #$%
@#$ $#@ This will let you see how traffic is doing #$%
@#$ $#@ There is that FF Crystal Chronicles game for Wii that has you build a city. #$%
@#$ $#@ " My life as king" #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, Im sure you could just emulate it on PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ What mods were you using, if you remember? #$%
@#$ $#@ This threads really given me an itch to revisit SC4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that just a miniaturized Express/Collector highway system? #$%
@#$ $#@ Much obliged, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like that map, I made a very memorable city on it last year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Count for what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its definitely a city builder, if thats what youre asking. #$%
@#$ $#@ sim city 2000 is a solved game #$%
@#$ $#@ How so? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im curious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never played 5 myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you use water towers or pumps? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not sure if towers have a range #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but major issues in my opinion have to do with the fewer building and service types compared to T4, the hyper-aggressive and omnipresent rebels, the horribly executed era system instead of getting buildings that are eventually obsoleted, you just dont get any buildings, and the even worse DLC jewery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty, but T4 is just a much better game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You werent kidding about having a long list. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just need to know if any of them are no longer particularly accessible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of it seems pretty self-explanatory otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ fockin noice #$%
@#$ $#@ So in other words, know where you're going and don't be the asshole who tries to exit at the last second. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks again, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this layout provide any benefits for traffci? #$%
@#$ $#@ You need to find ways to level up your buildings. #$%
@#$ $#@ Adding fire services, schools, public transportation, etc will make the buildings advance and increase your overall demand. #$%
@#$ $#@ No problem bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ Show a screenshot of your city. #$%
@#$ $#@ I use a combination of wind and coal until I could get nuclear, or you can use the tidal generators if you don't mind their look #$%
@#$ $#@ There isnt a single traffic light in the city and no 4 way intersections. #$%
@#$ $#@ This almost completely eliminates traffic jams. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only stopping trucks and whatnot cause jams. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what sucks in this picture? #$%
@#$ $#@ It needs less white color #$%
@#$ $#@ There are lots of good JP games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean new ones, no good new JP games. #$%
@#$ $#@ A few older ones are good #$%
@#$ $#@ Im looking forward to Mezozoica. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like Courage the Cowardly Dog lives there with two old farmers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing with vanilla/extinct/marine animals and not getting animals through archaeology was too damn slow tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Metros help but at that point in the game you're just playing for autism's sake #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that a mod allowing you to build over water or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as you read a guide on traffic so you understand how to make things flow correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Move out of Europe #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what you must do #$%
@#$ $#@ Anno 1404* #$%
@#$ $#@ Operation Genesis, man #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres heaps of awesome Recycling Plant mods. #$%
@#$ $#@ how much hell would flying cars cause, how do you make "lanes" like the sci-fi movies #$%
@#$ $#@ At that point we would probably have automation down pretty well, so they would just fly themselves in the most efficient way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if cars are still manually driven at that point, it would be the same fucking thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably some local connectivity reporting your and the lanes position shown visually through some display or projected inside the vehicle with head tracking. #$%
@#$ $#@ The lanes would just be a two dimensional matrix instead of one dimensional. #$%
@#$ $#@ You merge from one lane to the next in the same damn way except you have more sophisticated ways of checking whether the lane is clear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Skylines is comfy as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ what game m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah and how about those colors huh? #$%
@#$ $#@ everything should be black and white am i rite #$%
@#$ $#@ I do agree that SC4 looks really nice, but being 3D gives you more control over placement and stuffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only agree with the Downpour part. #$%
@#$ $#@ People just dont get that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well gee, it still sounds awful #$%
@#$ $#@ Heather would have to be old as shit if Laura was suppose to be a grown woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ thank fucking god it didnt get made #$%
@#$ $#@ The cult has managed to produce more interesting characters than anything past 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ The prison act tears down almost everything the game worked for, it was horrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both of those were some terrible shit, m8. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the cult brought an actual nice reason for why the town was the way it was. #$%
@#$ $#@ In all honesty theres nothing really more you can do with the cult at this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ But honestly we shouldnt recycle 2, how about something new and different altogether? #$%
@#$ $#@ Release order. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or, if you only want to play one, SH2 is where its at. #$%
@#$ $#@ Homecoming is awful, just throw it in the trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also I don't recommend Downpour but at least it's playable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shattered Memories is actually good but will get frustrating after the second other world section. #$%
@#$ $#@ The reason why a lot of people like Shattered Memories is it does a nice job creating a new story based on the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ The look and feel felt more akin to some stereotypical 06 emo rock music video. #$%
@#$ $#@ you bitch about this EVERY FUCKING Silent Hill thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ The games after four were dogshit in the atmosphere and gameplay department it doesnt even matter that your precious cult wasn't involved you fucking crybaby #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the closet thing to a classic Silent Hill made by the west. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was responsible for the death of his little brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually it depends on what year SH2 was supposed to take place. #$%
@#$ $#@ SH3 takes place 17 years after SH1, everyone knows that. #$%
@#$ $#@ And SH1 is estimated to take place in the 80s due to the models of cars seen throughout the game most notably Harrys making SH3 probably meant to be set in the early or mid 00s close to the 2004 release date of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ But SH2 as far as I remember is a bit more ambiguous as far as what year its set in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always assumed it took place in the 90s based off pretty much nothing but a hunch from my part. #$%
@#$ $#@ If that is the case, it wouldnt be implausible for Laura to already be an adult during even the events of SH3. #$%
@#$ $#@ While I think it would've been a stupid idea to involve her or Heather into this shit, it could've worked to have the two be close to each other in age. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might have been better in previous scripts... #$%
@#$ $#@ but seeing what we got, it probably was shit too. #$%
@#$ $#@ muh CRT #$%
@#$ $#@ fix that fucking aspect ratio #$%
@#$ $#@ They got so upset I thought I was doing something wrong and tried to convince myself I needed to buy an old tv to enjoy muh PS2 games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games look fine though. #$%
@#$ $#@ My dad's best friend's dog works at Nintendo. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got that joke #$%
@#$ $#@ Are they retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ Support for LCD was a thing in 2001. #$%
@#$ $#@ After this match. #$%
@#$ $#@ JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME #$%
@#$ $#@ Just be thankful you didnt get Xardion. #$%
@#$ $#@ your doing it wrong tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not called the FLAME MEISTER #$%
@#$ $#@ you're also doing it wrong tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Who needs AA when you've got dem thick scanlines #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn mate, get some S-video cables! #$%
@#$ $#@ Was your potato camera literally falling down as it took this picture? #$%
@#$ $#@ its written in japanese, idiot #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek, are you the guy from yesterday? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually written in Mandarin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im Chinese, btw. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I use a PS4 controller? #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna be messing with Raspberry Pi later on in my school, gonna try emulating on it since you gave me the idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just think the colors look more vibrant. #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoyed those extra pixels some CRTs displayed just outside the screens border. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does anyone have any idea what they were used for? #$%
@#$ $#@ factory adjusting the overscan #$%
@#$ $#@ flat screen crts have fucked up geometry #$%
@#$ $#@ This honestly hurts my fucking eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ How can CRT look so much better if we use flat screen nowaday? #$%
@#$ $#@ What filter is that? #$%
@#$ $#@ this picture perfectly shows how CRT era games look better on fucking CRTs. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you think the right looks better you are on literal crack right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right looks better. #$%
@#$ $#@ CRT seems to have a blue tint. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorta, I dont mind it too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Mario Maker sprites for newer entities are even worse WITH THE FUCKING BLACK OUTLINE #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy your input lag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, use your HDTV only with 8th gen consoles and 7th gen with component cables. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, it does work fine with my Wii U and the PS3... #$%
@#$ $#@ But it looks fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, the CRT makes a nice color gradient on the left picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its less sharp but also just as detailed. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's from that Hermione sex game or whatever #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks kinda fine, but HDTVs add input lag on old consoles, that's the real problem #$%
@#$ $#@ IT DOES?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Emulation will literally never be as good as original hardware. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not a filter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what a CRT looks like up close. #$%
@#$ $#@ People like you ruin the genre. #$%
@#$ $#@ the way you said "or just, you know" makes it seem like getting a scart cable is soooo much easier than downloading an emulator #$%
@#$ $#@ HDTVs are inherently worse and they cant compete with a crt, but game mode will reduce some of the inherent lag by getting rid of some post processing effects that cause more lag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just not the same... #$%
@#$ $#@ They're saying it like it's not that harder, especially in the age of internet delivery. #$%
@#$ $#@ Click 5 buttons fork over a 20 and wait a few days for a box to pop up at your door. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gruelling I lnoy but it's a tiny investment for the potential hundreds of hours you'll be spending playing games with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who and sauce? #$%
@#$ $#@ Angela White #$%
@#$ $#@ but that's still so much more time consuming effort for a result that's functionally indifferent to that of emulating it #$%
@#$ $#@ So how many more years before we have to say goodbye forever to crts? #$%
@#$ $#@ this really looks like ass #$%
@#$ $#@ F-Zero X Climax? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did people in the 90s play Ocarina of Time like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ This seriously hurts my eyes just by glancing it #$%
@#$ $#@ that's because its a shit picture #$%
@#$ $#@ Except for the mosaic on her genitals, whats the difference between doing JAV and regular? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would JAV be any better? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the actual thing doesn't look like that #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no S-Video cables, been meaning to get some off ebay though. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont buy the cheap chinese ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ they are shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you fuck up taking a picture this badly of a tv. #$%
@#$ $#@ damn what kind of emu/filter/shader setup is that? #$%
@#$ $#@ The patent expired in the late 90s. #$%
@#$ $#@ What advantage do they have over TVs made in the 2000s? #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want a flatscreen crt with component hookups for my old consoles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably because there were still the cheap shitty ones with the shadow mask designNot to say that shadow mask is always bad Still some great TV's from RCA and Toshiba in the early 2000's. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it has connections for Component I find thats a good sign. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn, that picture is how I remember FF7s graphics, not how they actually are. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is how it looks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had one of those. #$%
@#$ $#@ We blew it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea what im doing. #$%
@#$ $#@ the trinitron in the pic is literally the exact same one that I have. #$%
@#$ $#@ its amazing #$%
@#$ $#@ So just adjust the colors on your display? #$%
@#$ $#@ Aye fam, smh at the rest of the fam using actual hardware. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shets good dawg. #$%
@#$ $#@ My how much of a difference slopes make. #$%
@#$ $#@ We really took them for granted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, why? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont older console have more accurate emulation? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or do you mean because you like to play 3D games at higher resolutions than they were made in? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the upscaler preferable to playing on a CRT? #$%
@#$ $#@ What if your tv doesnt have an s-video input? #$%
@#$ $#@ why not just download fightcade and play against REAL people? #$%
@#$ $#@ New patch whatnow? #$%
@#$ $#@ What got changed with samus? #$%
@#$ $#@ She has shield breaker combos now, Missile to Charge Shot breaks shield, her Up B got stronger and her nair is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ She can put pressure on a shield now #$%
@#$ $#@ it's from reddit and doesn't mean shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is G&amp;W so low? #$%
@#$ $#@ He feels like one of the easiest and most fluid characters to play imo #$%
@#$ $#@ He has zero approach options and cant kill a thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Olimar is my highest main #$%
@#$ $#@ What makes Doc so much worse than Mario? #$%
@#$ $#@ Slow, no combos, horrible recovery #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant stand how right these tiers are. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am pretty good Roy but fuck a zss is hard to hit #$%
@#$ $#@ I play Wario, and without U-air killing until like 120-130% and only tippered, his main issue is kill moves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre all slow and require hard reads with the exception of ledge trump b-air. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like sure Wario has an awesome kill move in the fart, but if they just roll or air dodge, there goes your chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wario's rare because he's hard to play well #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Itll die eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please argue how Lucina is better than Marth. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dare you. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok tbh fam..... #$%
@#$ $#@ How is G-dorf that low. #$%
@#$ $#@ what weak pussy made this shit for idiots? #$%
@#$ $#@ Tiers are based half on tournament placings and half on theorycrafting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you ever seen a Ganondorf in place in any Top 32? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lucina doesnt have a tipper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but christ what a retarded reply. #$%
@#$ $#@ He didn't say "Why isn't Dorf A or S tier", he said, why is he so low on the list. #$%
@#$ $#@ Top 32 is a bullshit comparison. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ youre dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you even bother replying? #$%
@#$ $#@ I main Ganondorf better than any other idiot in /v/, and I can tell you that Ganondorf belongs in the bottom 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe above of the bottom 5 at least, but hey, the update literatly made the distance between tiers closer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll see you in top 32 as a Marth then #$%
@#$ $#@ what is MALLC #$%
@#$ $#@ his upsmash kills plenty for me #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why is this the new patch tier list? #$%
@#$ $#@ Big house didnt use the new patch... #$%
@#$ $#@ what did? #$%
@#$ $#@ What made Gunner shoot up so much? #$%
@#$ $#@ No the sword keeps going through shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe thats justme though. #$%
@#$ $#@ stop believing everything you see on the internet, especially the cancer that is the Smash Reddit specifically #$%
@#$ $#@ It's been a year and Smashboards still doesn't have their own tier list. #$%
@#$ $#@ When are we going to get a real one and not this reddit shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mewtwo being low is one of the least contested placements in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well if you were to see everything spread out instead of a list you'd see a massive gap between the top and bottom #$%
@#$ $#@ Dash Attack and Jab 1 are still unsafe, and a faster grab would be nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise I think Samus is fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario being hight tier is nothing new. #$%
@#$ $#@ His projectiles are more safe on sheild. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was already top tier, Zero. #$%
@#$ $#@ it made it, just not in the US version because adult themes and naked tube children #$%
@#$ $#@ I've noticed more and more annoying fucking Mario's on FG as people realize his combo potential is God tier and his frame data lets you just spam moves without getting punished. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ryu is so much fun to play though #$%
@#$ $#@ besides rosalina being in a and my bias for my main to be higher, this is pretty much accurate #$%
@#$ $#@ I found out the hard way the other day that the U-tilt insta-kills shields. #$%
@#$ $#@ My G&amp;W had no chance #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people dont have the technical skill to pull off pikachu. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's a very precise character, if you fuck up a read chances are you're going to get knocked off the stage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because hes actually not top tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nario consistently gets top 3 with ZSS and ESAM always has a hard time getting top 8 at nationals, yet people keep placing Pikachu top 3 on tier lists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, I probably shouldve put custom Palutena in tier 3 or bottom of 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Light Weight and Super Speed are no fucking jokes. #$%
@#$ $#@ She can play like Snake and just fucking randomly deal 50% damage to you in the span of a second or two. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes got the tools to fuck anyone up, or at least break even. #$%
@#$ $#@ Execution in Smash? #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ He actually has the third best air mobility. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yoshi is 1, Jiggs is 2, and Wario and Roy are tied for 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where do I find the patch notes for the recent patch? #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything with Ike? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does Ike get so many buffs? #$%
@#$ $#@ More Sakurai bias? #$%
@#$ $#@ Characters like Samus are still shit tier and barely get anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not saying Ike shouldnt get anything, but come on Sakurai, stop your shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only move thats worse on shield now is up smash. #$%
@#$ $#@ It used to be something to use for crash bomb setups, but its not so great for that anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Ikes current moveset can be good while Samus needs to be reworked from scratch to be decent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause he gets fucking wrecked before hitting 100% and his moves have jank as fuck sweet and sour points. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get embarrassed by macs all the time #$%
@#$ $#@ On the topic of Ike, anyone know any useful practical uses for his neutral B? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the one move I can't find a way to work in. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just seems really useless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Edgeguarding and hard reads. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a lot of people expect that thing to hit from above. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, it seems like it would be real janky to work with, but Ill give it a shot. #$%
@#$ $#@ His spam makes him quite friendly to For Glory scrubs but he really is garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ He and Palutena have lag out the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ He got a shit ton of changes... #$%
@#$ $#@ To custom moves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its just the underdog mentality, but I love playing Doc more than Mario. #$%
@#$ $#@ ROB and Mii Brawler sure got knocked down, unless this isnt in order. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, wasnt Mii Brawler also A tier? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just hate trying to recover as him. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of his short coming could be overlooked for me, but his recovery hurts #$%
@#$ $#@ No clue. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if japan considered him bottom-tier or something #$%
@#$ $#@ He wouldnt be that high without customs though, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ This has to assume hes allowed access to all his moves, otherwise he should be placed much lower. #$%
@#$ $#@ Styles is a fraud #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you learn the match up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Learn how your character work, learn how other characters work, learn the fundamentals and just keep playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the match up is truly impossible for you then go find a counter or something, but the rest still applies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to locals. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being able to play with good players and being able to talk to said good players will help you improve immensely. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people are more than willing to help someone new learn matchups and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Shulk neutral with buster is much safer now and also better, i can break shield with a d-tilt to f-smash or three d-tilts #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty sure this tier list is from some random reddit fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one who knew anything would make a new one 3 days after a major patch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just seems he gets lower and lower on every tier list I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd love for this random reddit fuck to be wrong and Link to be secret OP but it hasn't happened in the last 3 games and I'm doubting it'll happen now. #$%
@#$ $#@ His frame data is awful #$%
@#$ $#@ basically his moves are slow and laggy as shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ even his Nair? #$%
@#$ $#@ even his nair #$%
@#$ $#@ damn, so theres no hope for him being viable then? #$%
@#$ $#@ because she's not braindead like 95% of the cast and plays really fucking weird #$%
@#$ $#@ Also some would say he has potential since MALLC hasnt been optimized #$%
@#$ $#@ 16, but will deny it with fervor #$%
@#$ $#@ So is your mom, but I still played her. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not Moe the Clown #$%
@#$ $#@ it was a mixed bag, it felt too easy, the notepad was goodI didn't use it because I actually forgot it existed but I don't think it is a bad optional thing to have, the check for examined objects on scenes was fucking goat, but the fact that you couldn't even examine every place was fucking shit, also the soundtrack was generally meh, the 3d was good enough, the second case was the worst case in my opinion and I dind't like how the fifth case ended. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is the only case I remember being disgusted at, maybe because I was younger when I played the others, but I just felt like the case was progressing without me, they were reching conclusion after conclusion and I was just left at the dust, this had never happened to me in any other caseand I played every single game save for aaxpl #$%
@#$ $#@ ginger hibito? #$%
@#$ $#@ put this down a while until i got to the space case. #$%
@#$ $#@ what was the second case again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think that almost every second case tells you who the culprit is in the beggining cut sceneat least aa1 did, I personally just didn't like how it unfolded #$%
@#$ $#@ LET JUNIPER FREE #$%
@#$ $#@ How could you even make it that far? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see how any sane person could do the school case without swearing off the franchise forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is no way anyone can unironically think this. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is most definitely the worst case in the entire franchise. #$%
@#$ $#@ DD truly was made for the Reddit audience #$%
@#$ $#@ as much as I dislike kay and her gimmick, I consider aai2 a better game than dd #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well you see Chocolate chip cookies are pretty delicious and she does always have her magic panties. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably just wanted to do something sweet for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Of all the poses, they use the dramatic one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shake my head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you really just type that all out and not realize how convoluted DDs case-sequence is compared to the other games? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not very impressive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know about either Investigations, but look at its competition in the other main games: Turnabout Samurai, Turnabout Big Top, Recipe for Turnabout, and Turnabout Serenade. #$%
@#$ $#@ DD practically wins best third case by default. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the first one from? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was better than Apollo Justice, thats for damn sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a hard time comparing it to DD, whose strengths were in different areas than LvW. #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot the Golden Court. #$%
@#$ $#@ No thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather have non-meme games that don't focus on pandering to waifufaggots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why, so they can make it edgy Persona-wannabe weebshit? #$%
@#$ $#@ That bear is legit one of the worst mascot designs in the history of vidya, straight up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too late; FE14 has guaranteed video games are dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone knows AA4 is shit, doesnt make DR any less shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see no contradiction in that statement. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its your nostalgia goggles blocking out all the terrible shit in the first three games, because there was plenty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed, Apollo is much too high for such a void of a character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe he could rate 30 in a post-DD world, but before that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Surely not above 60. #$%
@#$ $#@ Le loud Phoenix isnt much of a character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apollo was ridiculous in AA5. #$%
@#$ $#@ Out of nowhere, a character we never met is turned into a motivation for him to become a clone of MGS4 Raiden, and he decides to act like an edgelord who has to wear an eyepatch because some bitch kept lying to him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not like he ever got anything like that happen in AA4, nah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes regular Apollo for half the game though. #$%
@#$ $#@ The simple fact that he didnt replace phoenix was enough to save him. #$%
@#$ $#@ From how fucking overladen the game is with creepy fanservice, not to mention the fucking face-rubbing, your argument means nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ You lie, just like everyone lied about 13 being great. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's fucking no way FE14 brought back FE5's advanced AI. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing he did that was stupid was the bandages on the arm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything else has a purpose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy the best 2 cases in AA, and dont let original trilogy cucks tell you that DD is bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop using in-universe reasoning, you fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Next youre going to tell me Robin whats-her-face has a reason for pretending to be a guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The reason was to pander to my reverse-trap fetish. #$%
@#$ $#@ On second thought the bandages are probably to prevent the bracelet from working although its only on one arm so I guess fashion for the other? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre being deceived. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never believe anything without seeing it for yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ 9's only flaw is that it's too easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pirate the game if you dont believe me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a very nice translation patch that translates a good chunk of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ And pointless. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game sets up several plot points that are all resolved in the next game, while all you accomplish in 9 is killing some warmonger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not playing it until I have an actual physical copy of the dub. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking language barrier. #$%
@#$ $#@ But FE4 has video gamings greatest plot twist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other than Sigurd getting cucked to death, and map size, theres not much going for 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a ventriloquist in fiction that isnt respectively the worst character of that series? #$%
@#$ $#@ They either have some possession gimmick you can see miles away or they are cripplingly spineless betas that use their puppet as an excuse to be a dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apollo Justice's witnesses and his prosecutor fuck Klavier's air guitar faggotry all have annoying animations that take forever, much longer than the witnesses in the other games. #$%
@#$ $#@ That guy was the worst with his fucking hand and his fucking book. #$%
@#$ $#@ im sorry were you expecting someone to give a shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ not real fam #$%
@#$ $#@ don't get excited, it's not real #$%
@#$ $#@ The story, settings, and characters click with you or they dont. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats really about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The gameplay isnt particularly memorable. #$%
@#$ $#@ i know lol #$%
@#$ $#@ ebin memer #$%
@#$ $#@ GTAV was $60 tho #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 years after console release, 6 years would be way too ridiculous even with how shitty the industry is. #$%
@#$ $#@ RDR is one of the most desired games by PCfats, high demand = high price #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot the part where everyone would it but only for $5 on a Steam sale #$%
@#$ $#@ eh I guess I really think for this game and its age $60 is pretty far fetched #$%
@#$ $#@ why would you want to? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a problem? #$%
@#$ $#@ k, thx reddit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like itd just encourage more people to pirate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have a hard time believing many would pay that much for an old game. #$%
@#$ $#@ All you niggas have ten seconds to explain why we haven't seen a game with ragdoll physics and as good as RDR since the game's release. #$%
@#$ $#@ gc &amp; ps2 are okay with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played everything I wanted to play no issue. #$%
@#$ $#@ full price for a 7 year old game... #$%
@#$ $#@ come on man too obvious #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to really throw yourself into it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do the hunting shit maybe my favorite part of the game and do the herb shit too not that great but its still worth a go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its an rpg disguised as a 3rd person shooter really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Going around in a duster and dragging people around with a lasso is some of the most fun Ive ever had in a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ But to answer the original question, the part were you kill the Mexican general is the best part of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, Mexico in general is amazing in RDR #$%
@#$ $#@ So if they slightly upscale it you will pay $60? #$%
@#$ $#@ SONYGERS BTFO #$%
@#$ $#@ You realize GTAV PC is a cheap port? #$%
@#$ $#@ did you try the expansion? #$%
@#$ $#@ its better than the actual game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aside from a change in CPU architecture which is very easy seeing as x86 is fully documented, there would be no reason for a large difference in cost to port the two games. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can do better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ PCfats has been a term used here for years newfriend #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if it's fake, that small moment where I thought it might be true was the happiest I've been in a while #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does the age of the game matter? #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be the first time PC people would be playing it #$%
@#$ $#@ Cucks dont actually exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ 'Cuck' is the SJW term for FAGGOT, which used to actually mean something. #$%
@#$ $#@ No it hasn't #$%
@#$ $#@ Never Ever they said #$%
@#$ $#@ 360 version of RDRedemption is 720p while PS3 version is 640p. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a 360 #$%
@#$ $#@ You have something to be mad about right now anon #$%
@#$ $#@ You are thinking of Bioshock #$%
@#$ $#@ This I found everything to be forgettable #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone who speaks English speaks the same dialect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone except Scottish people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, youre also forgetting Cockneys probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a burger so I don't actually know #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard to believe, since when it was revealed, they said it would be on PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's right, faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ But it isnt real. #$%
@#$ $#@ the link is a fake link. #$%
@#$ $#@ No hes not, sorry. #$%

@#$ $#@ Hi Chris. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh you mean those anonymous posts made through that one site where you can review your workplace without any sort of proof? #$%
@#$ $#@ I work for 4chan, our soul Essence is being sold to Ford by Hiroshima. #$%
@#$ $#@ a classic #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure the Escapist is Pro-GG. #$%
@#$ $#@ B...but how can Pro-GG be unethical? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont forget anyone who is still butthurt about GG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody gives a shit about your opinion faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to Reddit.com™ #$%
@#$ $#@ glassdoor was actually the source. #$%
@#$ $#@ just look up roberts industries on the site, the reviews are still up, with dates from before the article. #$%
@#$ $#@ with the same writing style and similar posting dates as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ would not be surprised at all if just the same person wrote these things #$%
@#$ $#@ "neutral" that aspie bitch ? #$%
@#$ $#@ hahahaha she is one of the most annoying faGGots ever, basically she spents her entire day on twitter correcting/antagonizing any liberal/feminist/chick with blue hair she can find #$%
@#$ $#@ literally who #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but its a girl that shits on other girls? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds pretty lulzy. #$%
@#$ $#@ She should keep on keepin on. #$%
@#$ $#@ But what proof was the public given besides "Alright guys these guys used to work at CIG and this is what they said" #$%
@#$ $#@ She was pro GG before, now shes neutral. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont identify as GG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frankly it doesnt matter, if youre not Anti-GG youre all the same to some people. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was very pro-GG for a while, but when she got doxed and people started threatening her kid she quieted down on the subject. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't follow her, that's her statement. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actions may not reflect her words. #$%
@#$ $#@ Google if you dont believe me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone have that pic of the SJs tracking down a kids facebook and threatening him? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you talk to her, she's still very much proGG, she just doesn't talk about it anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think that was /baph/ #$%
@#$ $#@ I have. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anonymous sources have always been and always will be controversial. #$%
@#$ $#@ It requires a certain degree of trust. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frankly, I dont believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ The anonymous sources claim that Sandi Gardiner was a bigot in email, and they dont even have a screen cap of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ They could have easily removed personal information from the email, as should it as proof. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't trust the Escapist, especially since it's said that other publications denied this story. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a famous publication picked this up I would believe it. #$%
@#$ $#@ They did't because they now this story doesn't have merit. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Y-L mite b cool, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not as if all games on kikestarter have failed in development even though I know the popular doublethink is to believe so. #$%
@#$ $#@ does it even exist anymore after 8 got swiped away from Fred? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, unless the Escapist meant that they discovered that Chris Roberts was personally putting trace amounts of lead into each employee's lunch, I'm assuming they meant the social sciences buzzword with literally no concrete meaning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fair enough, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for being civil in the conversation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop pretending kickstart somehow invalidates the potential for success. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that's what /v/ has instructed you to do, but I'm sure you can decide for yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people are able to figure it out as its a really shitty office environment/workplace. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course I forget my image. #$%
@#$ $#@ No problem anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Love me some corporate drama. #$%
@#$ $#@ Derek Smart is known for something. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats the context of this? #$%
@#$ $#@ i never found out #$%
@#$ $#@ Its an edit. #$%
@#$ $#@ lucky you #$%
@#$ $#@ it's based on an old /x/ pasta called the dogscape where the entire planet is made of dog flesh #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, it's Derek's mother here, you two coming over for Thanksgiving? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill make sure not to invite my fag-ass son who I should have aborted this time. #$%
@#$ $#@ All games journalists are incompetent hacks, Star Citizen will be shit out as half a game right before CIG hits insolvency, and Derek Smart is a mongoloid who occasionally finds himself on the right side of an argument purely by chance #$%
@#$ $#@ Do they plan on using backer money to fund a lawsuit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because that is playing RIGHT into what Smart has said he hopes to cause. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Chris Roberts would be taking the high ground and condemning someone else for failing to deliver while he himself would have failed to deliver. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would help if they all stopped being massive failures. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Derek Smart spent half the time working on games than he does criticizing people on the internet, Line of Defense would be out of Early Access by now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Derek smart is not a legendary Usenet troll. #$%
@#$ $#@ Derek smart is someone who was very easily trolled and would immediately go full internet tough guy and threaten legal action against anybody and everybody who called one of his games a buggy piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except we can clearly see hes toppling a 90 million dollar project and rustling the CEO with just a few tweets, even though he has 5,000 followers and a history of questionable games. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is unreal. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least we know they arent just spending money to do that on reddit now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not a marketing firm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ This whole "game" is like a fucking cult. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude its the furries. #$%
@#$ $#@ For some reason theyre dumping tons of money into this. #$%
@#$ $#@ And theyll defend to the death their bad decisions. #$%
@#$ $#@ how much did you spend on the game bro? #$%
@#$ $#@ Derek Smarts a cunt but you gotta be retarded to keep falling for games that promise YOU CAN DO ANYTHING nonstop. #$%
@#$ $#@ When will you fuckers learn to notice when something sounds too good to be true? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi Kacho, dont you have someone to subtweet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Derek Smart is supremely buttmad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taht shit owned #$%
@#$ $#@ very much so #$%
@#$ $#@ escapist and derek smart are right on the money about scam citizen. #$%
@#$ $#@ its great to see tons of people are now demanding money back from that scam. #$%
@#$ $#@ roberts is a fucking laughing stock. #$%
@#$ $#@ and everyone see's that gg gives a shit about gamers #$%
@#$ $#@ Chris pls go #$%
@#$ $#@ its was mostly because they are black #$%
@#$ $#@ So are any of his games actually good, or at least interesting to play? #$%
@#$ $#@ Been waiting on a Linux port of this for like 15 years now... #$%
@#$ $#@ come on Derek! #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks at least unique and interesting, seems like its probably not a lot of fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did this nigger honestly think what he made was fun or playable? #$%
@#$ $#@ Freelancer and Freespace are space sims, too, yet they still manage to be fun while maintaining a learning curve. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive figuratively grown up making fun of Derek Smart, not about to stop now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Always and forever, an asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ DEREK SMARTS DESKTOP COMMANDER! #$%
@#$ $#@ are you l33t liek jeff k? #$%
@#$ $#@ And Battlecruiser 3000AD. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Universal Combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ And recently Line of Defense, both Tactics and the MMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ The guy is sure thick skinned, must have been all that coke machine punching. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dumb bloggers who are too young to know who Derek Smart is. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was basically the Chris Chan of game developers back in the late 90s. #$%
@#$ $#@ who better to call out a scam artist then a scam artist? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Derek Smart has been calling Chris Roberts a scam artist since the 1990s. #$%
@#$ $#@ The man who made Battlecruiser 3000AD and Universal Combat has been calling the man who made all these games a scam artist, a hack, and a thief for 2 decades. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately for the articles author, they are going to have to throw her under the bus and fire her if the article was bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is pretty much always the only way to avoid a libel lawsuit if you legitimately write a libelous article. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi derek #$%
@#$ $#@ hello voice of reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chris Roberts has been hiring family members since he started making games with his brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is nothing wrong with hiring family members as long as they are not being put in positions of high power. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you don't like the fact that Chris Roberts likes to work with his family and friends, you don't have to buy his games. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is a game developer, not a government official or the head of a major corporation. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they lied on company ID, how can we take their claim seriously ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lizzy made a mistake referring to the security card as an ID card which in no way discredits the source or her work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, she was wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it doesnt matter in the slightest. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the equivalent of a typo. #$%
@#$ $#@ derek smart has nothing to do with this, he didn't write the article and he wasn't a source according to the escapist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fur citizens trying to change the subject. #$%
@#$ $#@ The escapist is pro-pageviews. #$%
@#$ $#@ The air content both for and against it #$%

@#$ $#@ T-thanks doc #$%
@#$ $#@ THANKS FAM #$%
@#$ $#@ i keep seeing this guy on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ he takes the cake for the worst retard who ever graced the souls series with his presence #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did nothing wrong anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Click the X in the upper right corner anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dare you faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ did this game even come out in the america? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hows the online? #$%
@#$ $#@ more dog pls #$%
@#$ $#@ More games need more of this chopper. #$%
@#$ $#@ RIP ;_;7 #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to drop in from the buzzard and knife his face, but some random enemy blew him up for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh well #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, you'd expect the remake to at least fix that #$%
@#$ $#@ just garuda really #$%
@#$ $#@ That dude looks kind of girly. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then you lose all the territory you've gained as soon as you finish The Green Sabre #$%
@#$ $#@ and doesn't even give you said op weapon after the ending of the game or plain easy because it's supposed to be won without weapons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id gladly trade all my weapons for a hacker weapon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude you only lose your weapons for maybe five minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ You still have your wrench and electrobolt. #$%
@#$ $#@ what game does this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Deus Ex human Revolution sorta did this in the third boss if you were gullible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hello Dark Forces, my old friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fight with Asgore starts with him chucking his trident at the Mercy button. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good thing those fat PCtards isnt getting the game otherwise they would just meme all the time am i rite guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Name me a good linear game #$%
@#$ $#@ LAFING OUT LOUD #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario kart 64 #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats such a minor difference, with that logic no game ever is linear unless its literally a straight line walking simulator with no jumping. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get it. #$%
@#$ $#@ check your privilege #$%
@#$ $#@ play dota #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont either. #$%
@#$ $#@ im guessing the child is a boy trying to be more feminine or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont know #$%
@#$ $#@ Every fucking Arcade game ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ This makes me upset. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MINECRAFT? #$%
@#$ $#@ What movie was she watching? #$%
@#$ $#@ What the hell is your definition of "Linear"? #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I say Half-Life or is that non linear because I can opt to jump into a chasm sometimes, or choose not to win a firefight? #$%
@#$ $#@ In Tetris I can choose lots of different ways to put down my pieces, I guess that makes it on-par with The Elder Scrolls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ace Ventura #$%
@#$ $#@ The worst sidekicks are the ones that walk faster than you walk but slower than you run. #$%
@#$ $#@ FF7 I guess? #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't dew it man #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking tell me about it #$%
@#$ $#@ LOL indeed #$%
@#$ $#@ kinda off topic but what emulator do you guys recommend using? #$%
@#$ $#@ I kinda want to replay contra 3 on the snes if I remember that correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ No it doesnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because you like the villain doesnt automatically mean the protag is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Higan/bsnes or SNES9X. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont use Zsnes, it was abandoned a decade ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet there's an online version of Contra so no need for emulatin #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it does and anon was right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at Ass Creed 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Far Cry 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks guys #$%
@#$ $#@ Why people think linear games are bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not every game needs to ve open world or have more than one ending, even if a game give you many paths but you still reach the same ending that is not a bad thing #$%
@#$ $#@ BUT MUH FREE EXPRESSION #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, what's wrong with West Virginia #$%
@#$ $#@ Many, many things. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant for the life of me remember who they were making that face at. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember that they were gathered around to have a meeting about how to work together to get Batman, but who were they looking at? #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks mountain dew #$%
@#$ $#@ I've tried all the different Dew Flavorstm, and all of them are diabetes level sweet, I like sweet shit, but it's way too much for me #$%
@#$ $#@ whos this fluid druid #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldnt you just say y = x? #$%
@#$ $#@ Like what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone should edit this image with your better code. #$%
@#$ $#@ // is only a single line comment #$%
@#$ $#@ Its an emulator, it emulates. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zsnes is less accurate therefore worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is why the lines that have actual code in them dont have // before them. #$%
@#$ $#@ One could argue that if x isnt true or false, then y = x could cause bugs later on. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it doesnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having a more likeable villain does not instantly equate to shitty protag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Big Boss is an overall likeable protag of MGS3, yet some of the villains are more likeable than him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Letho is a more likeable character than Geralt, and hes the villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt seem much sweeter than other sodas to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Lady Gaga, how did you not get that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you going to watch her on AHS Hotel this wed? #$%
@#$ $#@ For some reason i dont really get this one, please send help #$%
@#$ $#@ The guy who wrote it had a college degree in CS. #$%
@#$ $#@ So these are right-wing comics making fun of liberals, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ lady gaga, bad romance #$%
@#$ $#@ couldn't Chun Li's Alpha look be considered "awful" #$%
@#$ $#@ but its just a bunch of floats #$%
@#$ $#@ At Croc for saying he threw a rock at Batman when they were all telling "Almost got him" stories. #$%
@#$ $#@ post the broken neck please #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you man. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember that now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really need to rewatch the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but whats wrong with it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The lack of properly naming the floats? #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel the same way when I watch Drawn Together, except the opposite. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wheres the joke, buckley? #$%
@#$ $#@ Good Burger. #$%
@#$ $#@ No problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love BAS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not funny -_- #$%
@#$ $#@ For the first time since the game released Ive browsed a thread other than undertale threads and here this image is. #$%
@#$ $#@ The comic in OPs post is SPECIFICALLY labelled as The Game World, as in level design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop being a fucking idiot, all of your examples are referring to everything besides the actual game world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself retarded piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ still mad #$%
@#$ $#@ based grandpa #$%
@#$ $#@ wait, incest is now mainstream? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah bro, you been living under a rock or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually agreed with parts of this #$%
@#$ $#@ if the bool is a primitive it has to be either true or false. #$%
@#$ $#@ were you triggered? #$%
@#$ $#@ cyber animal violence is equivalent to genocide #$%
@#$ $#@ I tensed the muscles in my face briefly #$%
@#$ $#@ DELETE THIS #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Winston Rowntree's work but he's so fucking pretentious. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure he's an asshole in real life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hng that pull. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am fucking triggered over here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, I get it, its deep because people have reasons for things, and its hypocritical to judge because there is information we dont know about them that could redeem them in the future or explain their attitude in the present! #$%
@#$ $#@ Truly genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still don't get this #$%
@#$ $#@ Its funny that if you didnt know the kid was supposed to be transgender you wouldnt get what was going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a grandfather said something like that to someone who was born a girl, hed be shown in a positive way for encouraging his granddaughter to be strong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah I just posted that to see what the fuck I even saved with that filename. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's some fucking retarded tumblr bullshit, I don't even remember why I saved it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to post this one. #$%
@#$ $#@ No its just a self insert and the author just displays how he reacts whenever someone triggers him #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Aaron trans now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Between Sisko and Dukat, Sisko wins #$%
@#$ $#@ Fair enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ why is this guy who did these comics the literal definition of edgelord #$%
@#$ $#@ de end #$%
@#$ $#@ Compere MGS1-4 to 5 #$%
@#$ $#@ Made me chuckle heartily #$%
@#$ $#@ Name of the comic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jazzy Jackrabbit #$%
@#$ $#@ Storytime of the pick-axe arm edgelord WHEN? #$%
@#$ $#@ This isnt even fair. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is clearly part of a series and taken out of context. #$%
@#$ $#@ For all we know it isnt even a comedy series. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it doesnt necessarily mean that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just means you come to respect the villain's vision more than the hero's. #$%
@#$ $#@ Happened with Tales of Symphonia for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ MY DICK #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get it, is the author a goody christfag or an edgelord? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this turn into a Jesus cartoon? #$%
@#$ $#@ hey fuck you Sazh is the only good part of that game #$%
@#$ $#@ I chuckled. #$%
@#$ $#@ BUT DON'T YOU REMEMBER IN FALLOUT FINDING THOSE SKELETONS IN A HOUSE HOLDING HANDS, SUCH DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT-BASED STORYTELLING DOESN'T SUIT A CAVEMAN BRO GAMER LIKE YOU WHO HAS TO HAVE EVERYTHING SPELLED OUT #$%
@#$ $#@ too real #$%
@#$ $#@ My nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its not Sonic and/or idols. #$%
@#$ $#@ First for 'FINAL PERSONA 4 SPINOFF' #$%
@#$ $#@ You poor naive son of man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe SMT fags will stop shitting on persona now that their franchise is relevant again #$%
@#$ $#@ go away vishmarx #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT4SE port to ps4/psv. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's Nintendo #$%
@#$ $#@ Confirmed Nintendo exclusive. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT IV x Persona 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ This is starting to look very likely. #$%
@#$ $#@ The word starts with a P and has NA in it #$%
@#$ $#@ read old thread #$%
@#$ $#@ how about just linking the source, drone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot pic related #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets hope it really is SMT V then. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4 was awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ PUT IT DOWN, ANON. #$%
@#$ $#@ I let the FBI know about this joking about bombing is never okay anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's time to level up, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Id love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ If P3 or P4G get ported to WiiU/3DS. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will live stream me breaking my vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make a post on reddit so we can actually hold you accountable to that. #$%
@#$ $#@ YFW SMT x FE was split into two projects and this is the SMT game #$%
@#$ $#@ Natural SMT #$%
@#$ $#@ The anarchist graffiti thing doesn't really fit Strange Journey's art style at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ But iPhone doesnt have psychical buttons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who wants to pay 500 dollars for playing games with shitty touch controls? #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a moga pro #$%
@#$ $#@ Controllers for smartphones dont support all games you know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Soon they will, apple is pushing their new apple tv as a gaming thing so their forcing devs to implement controller support #$%
@#$ $#@ Gee, I wonder why. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe because it was another android portable console with no interesting exclusives? #$%
@#$ $#@ If people want a portable console, they will buy PS Vita or 3DS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Worse that N-Gage? #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain me why. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's niche as fuck and didn't really get much advertising. #$%
@#$ $#@ N-Gage sold about 3 million units. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'd think Sony would have at least announced they've hit the 1 million sales mark by now. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 millions was the number of the units they shipped, not the number of the units that actually sold to the customers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most companies use units shipped including Sony because its usually close enough to the number of units sold. #$%
@#$ $#@ Retailers won't keep buying your product if they can't sell what they already have. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess when ever this game came out #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, I liked Shadow of Mordor. #$%
@#$ $#@ but anon thats 8th gen #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesn't make it good #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut your whore mouth #$%
@#$ $#@ Since always. #$%
@#$ $#@ N64 version was better. #$%
@#$ $#@ PS1 version ran like shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I seem to recall some horrible stuttering in certain levels in the PS1 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last level was nearly unplayable for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then again, maybe it WAS the N64 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also just realized how long ago that was and holy fuck I feel old. #$%
@#$ $#@ From Atari 2600 era. #$%
@#$ $#@ I emulated this and it wasnt that bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I don't know what what it was like back then, maybe compared to all the other atari games this was bottom of the barrel but what I played wasn't the worst thing ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're supposed to use the propeller plants to fly across the canyon, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ The good ones always were exceptions to the rule. #$%
@#$ $#@ i masturbate profusely #$%
@#$ $#@ Just keep playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a lot of people at high levels that can't play for shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can confirm. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had a level 42 do worse than level 23s #$%
@#$ $#@ theres a Splatoon 2?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Gold Dynamo Roller. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a Mad Catz F.L.Y.5 Stick for PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ My disposable income is pretty flexible but I'm just borrowing it since I don't foresee actually using it extensively. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill check out this DCS thing then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Copy that, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your reply. #$%
@#$ $#@ kill yourself john #$%
@#$ $#@ sage just doesnt make your post bump the thread you fucktarded ledditor #$%
@#$ $#@ No one cares about this retarded agenda shit except gamer culture, most people have more important shit to do and care about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever helps this ghoulish freak sleep at night. #$%
@#$ $#@ i sage your post tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its an affront to reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, at that sjw meetup #$%
@#$ $#@ Get saged faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ How long until all you Tumblrinas fuck off of my comic board you nigger? #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone more important than literally Wu #$%
@#$ $#@ while i know plenty of them are genuine, it always feels fake when a mtf CONSTANTLY brags and talks about how much they love tits and love girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, jesus, you're such a DUDE in a girls body, it's obnoxious and kind of feel like cheating? #$%
@#$ $#@ Faggots please leave /co/ and comics alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can have CN now but fuck off everything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know but this was the closest they ever got to doing it, and I know it will be the closest it will ever get and it will never happen but I can fucking dream ok #$%
@#$ $#@ It has more to do with the fact that the person in question is obviously very mentally disturbed. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't trust anything that comes from someone like that so why would I trust that person to label themselves correctly :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ They are both a mental abnormality, and neither of them prevent one from having the qualities needed to raise children well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because most people this day and age are capable of looking at things objectively? #$%
@#$ $#@ It implies someone disagrees with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ fukken sage #$%
@#$ $#@ Last I checked Caitlyn still prefered being called Bruce #$%
@#$ $#@ What you call Progressivism actually seemspretty regressive in a lot of ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like trying to police/shame the content of video games for being too violent or inappropriate. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are they even on about? #$%
@#$ $#@ How exactly are things going to change? #$%
@#$ $#@ Will women finally grow a pair and stop getting so emotional over random internet faggots? #$%
@#$ $#@ Buckle up, buckaroo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this shit work once you've fully developed, or does it only have huge changes like this when you're still growing? #$%
@#$ $#@ surgery can do wonders at any age. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the superficial ones #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just drivel, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats all there is to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone is self involved to an extent and this one is just living in a reality where its embarrassing war on Twitter is so big that hell be written down in history forever as a hero of justice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt it would work out quite that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats because slurs like tranny will be illegal and gender roles will cease to exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Friedman is a very talented guitar player, shame he doesn't get more attention than he deserves #$%
@#$ $#@ Women are incapable of cyberviolence. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless the patriarchy told them to do it of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ should have stayed a man, could have played a serial killer on law and order or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marty was too good for Megadeth anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ I find it strange that all of your images are from 4chan and are all relatively old. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you save them all from one thread or do you just so happen to name your files like 4chan? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's cool cause I unconditionally like Megadeth #$%
@#$ $#@ most guys are ugly #$%
@#$ $#@ Because sexisim = prejudice + power which means only men can be sexist. #$%
@#$ $#@ only men can be sexist. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a cherished doctrine in academia but provokes eye-rolling nearly everywhere else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeh nah. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shit is already over. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megadeth hasn't been good since Cryptic Writings and you know it #$%
@#$ $#@ Why dont you just already take the treatment and find out, you sissy faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not much of a vocalist though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's true that straight guys don't see effort in their looks and are 4/10 when they could be 8/10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does she have to go all goth, it makes her look terrible and depressed #$%
@#$ $#@ ey gimmie da pussi boss #$%
@#$ $#@ Mods are asleep since theyre all in the US timezone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post whatever you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ Teach me your secrets anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always see posts about how they hate "chasers" and men. #$%
@#$ $#@ The whole situation with Wu is rather comical. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a guy that speaks on behalf of women and in some how in some way females are okay with that because he identify's as a women or some shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck finding one that isnt mentally broken and a complete dramafiend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hasnt Nishimura fired all mods in 4chan? #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is wizards time. #$%

@#$ $#@ looks like shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Snake penis get. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is this person and why should I care? #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that the guy from Braindead 13? #$%
@#$ $#@ If I was the government, I wouldnt give trannies the right to adopt a child. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've yet to meet a single one that wasn't completely fucked in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you fucktards keep giving these people attention? #$%
@#$ $#@ References and memes have replaced humor, keep up grandpa. #$%
@#$ $#@ Check my 9 because this is a 9 get #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, Id like to try it at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with references? #$%
@#$ $#@ Miss Draper pls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im from the company. #$%
@#$ $#@ academic consensus is a "fallacy". #$%
@#$ $#@ These guys #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing is wrong with references. #$%
@#$ $#@ But when you have no actual jokes, no clever set ups, no sly lingual work, not even a tad bit of slapstick, just references where someone says "X IS JUST LIKE Y" then your comedy sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ 420 git #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she realised she's not happy with what she's done to herself. #$%
@#$ $#@ rollin mollin #$%
@#$ $#@ Referential humor is one of the laziest forms of comedy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fine in small doses but when you overely on it it gets tiresome. #$%
@#$ $#@ So basically all modern comedy and everything everyone under the age of 40 says on social media? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ey gurl #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you want to look androgynous and not trans? #$%
@#$ $#@ Still looks like a fucking man. #$%
@#$ $#@ So this is saying all those horrible cam videos where she saying shes in hiding is actual just in her house? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't consider black people twitter to be referential #$%
@#$ $#@ he was cuter at the beginning no homo #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes baiting the overly leftist media to push a pro-islamic agenda though. #$%
@#$ $#@ His father is a known islamic activist. #$%
@#$ $#@ don't laugh you slut #$%
@#$ $#@ BIG MISTAKE TBH #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone doesn't go in hiding while simultaneously courting every media opportunity #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn son. #$%
@#$ $#@ cunny Im home #$%
@#$ $#@ Im cool with androginous bodies, I prefer flat chest over fake tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ But for me you have to consider yurself a girl and dress like one all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ The moment I see somebody as a male, I just stop sucking his dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Im not gay. #$%
@#$ $#@ your mom's dick #$%
@#$ $#@ SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ it's /mlp/'s year baby #$%
@#$ $#@ Where is the rules? #$%
@#$ $#@ Haha, good one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually looking back at the rules, its funny that the /mlp/ section still includes a mention of Filly Funtasia, even though that shit died out after only a few weeks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like its only existence was to herald in the creation of GR15. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mod nap time seems to be taking longer than usual today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you ok /v/ mod? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you wanna talk about it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because this thread is fucking garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ And if theres nothing going on go make some thread about a video game you want to talk about. #$%
@#$ $#@ good taste tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ It started the 15th, it ends in a few days. #$%
@#$ $#@ It finally got done. #$%
@#$ $#@ That song art is fucking spot on, holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny how now Open Worlds are finally considered for the boring shit they are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Until last gen, open word was nothing more than just a buzzword. #$%
@#$ $#@ That Skull Face Grinch parody is the best thing I've ever heard #$%
@#$ $#@ We have multiple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just look at the spreadsheet what we've already sung in less than 3 weeks #$%
@#$ $#@ Do it, you magnificent bastard #$%
@#$ $#@ What movie is that from?, I remember the musical but not the movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, at this point, if a new singer wants to try it, hes very welcome. #$%
@#$ $#@ So now? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's pretty great, I gotta admit #$%
@#$ $#@ Asterix and Cleopetra #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems now people prefer to make covers about unfinished products. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any feels songs this year? #$%
@#$ $#@ Closest I've heard is "Playing TF2" or "Gamer Boy" #$%
@#$ $#@ Deadline for writing songs was like a few days ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ The overall deadline in a few days, no strict date yet as far as I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ post the original and the pastebin alongside so people know what you're talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ Its my favorite too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice, looking forward to it fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're looking great so far #$%
@#$ $#@ I find using some mouth wash helps me a bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, be sure to breathe through your nose rather then your mouth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jokes on you the threads are most active during bongtime. #$%
@#$ $#@ What higher form of entertainment do you expect? #$%
@#$ $#@ Should we do a poetry slam next year? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a big meme #$%
@#$ $#@ because nobody actually curates this and it's pretty well done #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no time limit on videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone could make a video for a song next July. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who could, or would, stop them? #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as you've got the corrected music with the videos then it's good mate #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but Songman was considering posting it to cuckchan instead because they only have 5 songs #$%
@#$ $#@ It happened too late fam #$%
@#$ $#@ very last chance to leave feedback before I render the final version of 40 thieves. #$%
@#$ $#@ alright, thatll do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uploading now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is this "Jerald"? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont remember him in the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Virtual boobies m8. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I guess I'll flag it as 18+ or whatever once I upload the final version as public #$%
@#$ $#@ is anyone doing a video for that one? #$%
@#$ $#@ Were not taking new lyrics. #$%
@#$ $#@ There might be a Splatoon song in the list for the singing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Squid Kid Ass is So Fine still hasnt been sung properly I believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more of a personal project. #$%
@#$ $#@ No ones saying the guy who posted it on reddit isnt a total fag, nor that reddit should get/enjoy it, but its annoying to see people come out with this even joke racism is racism, im more matur than u spiel, especially on a site like leddit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's great fam, but try uploading in higher quality if at all possible #$%
@#$ $#@ Fair enough, i guess, doesnt make their attitude any less obnoxious though. #$%
@#$ $#@ well it is reddit after all #$%
@#$ $#@ Change 'yuck' to 'yap', imo #$%
@#$ $#@ I watched a documentary on Chris-chan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Interesting, yet disturbing stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive written quite a few songs. #$%
@#$ $#@ This feeling will never go away unless somebody absolutely nails it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just embrace it, youll grow to like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Throw some ideas around and you can have them in an hour #$%
@#$ $#@ Its usually the very last step in the musical process. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude this is fucking good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Great Job! #$%
@#$ $#@ Doubt theres much sjw nonsense songs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Put them together with ecelebs #$%
@#$ $#@ remove the have, I forgot to delete it when looking over my post #$%
@#$ $#@ Disregard this post, I suck cocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4 albums I'd say #$%
@#$ $#@ druid and CIA really rockin them red lips. #$%
@#$ $#@ Inb4 "it's just a meme chill out bro" #$%
@#$ $#@ Eternal reminder that nobody will start curating this musical just because you feel strongly about a meme that might have originated on another board #$%
@#$ $#@ I suppose we've had our Meme-album title chosen for us #$%
@#$ $#@ a challenger appears #$%
@#$ $#@ clean it up a bit and it's perfect #$%
@#$ $#@ aw fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ what thread number did he appear in? #$%
@#$ $#@ Druids have been done each year, it fits #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a damn fine cover btw #$%
@#$ $#@ I like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know #$%
@#$ $#@ If i had a mic, I would totally embarass myself and sing this song. #$%
@#$ $#@ He ded. #$%
@#$ $#@ He said hed get it done end of this week, so should have been today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully soon, would be a shame to release without it #$%
@#$ $#@ Neutral good #$%
@#$ $#@ consider yourself a retard if you pick anything other than bottom right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only "lol so randum" kids go chaotic netural. #$%
@#$ $#@ How would you describe a game that, while it actually does get harder, it feels like it's getting easier because you've improved as a player? #$%
@#$ $#@ Middle one #$%
@#$ $#@ If anyone picks Chaotic good they are full of shit or actually believe /v/s one-up manship bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Middle right is probably the best one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bit easier at first but gets harder as you get further in the game #$%
@#$ $#@ i prefer normal to hard or hard all the way through but when im playing a shit designed game with tons of grinding for no reason i play on easy just to pass through all the boring shit then i turn my difficulty back up once the real game has started #$%
@#$ $#@ What would you prefer? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Dwarf Fortress really that difficult? #$%
@#$ $#@ Same with the Witcher games #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a lot to learn, the difficulty lies in how quick you are to understand it. #$%
@#$ $#@ it has a very steep learning curve. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not, its just the same kind of meme that made Dark Souls/Demons Souls popular. #$%
@#$ $#@ So I can go back in time if I play dwarf fortress? #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless youre some kind of autistic child you wont know what youre doing for awhile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the perfect kind of game for people who want to look patrician to brag about playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ First couple of times maybe, but once you can get a fort up on its feet and know the UI you are fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ The real challenge comes from going into evil or savage locations and trying to survive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you played it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a dwarf sim. #$%
@#$ $#@ Middle right is perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark Souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything in 3 or the first one of 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off casual shitter #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty close. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was thinking Demon's Souls #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck no, why would I play a shitty autism simulator? #$%
@#$ $#@ what does this term even mean anymore? #$%
@#$ $#@ obviously the disjointed line represents the bare minimum skill you need and the maximum skill at the same time #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all high difficulties are just turning enemies into damage sponges or lowering your own health #$%
@#$ $#@ 3rd column is where its at. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, it just turns any graph into a horrible plane of suffering for stick people. #$%
@#$ $#@ More like how hard it is to understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Older NES games, like Megaman, is hard but easy to understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dworf is hard to get into simply because not everyone can understand how the menus works, let alone the whole mechanics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best answer here #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the beauty of DF #$%
@#$ $#@ nintodler detected #$%
@#$ $#@ At some points, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like easier the game the more I make mistakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ When the game has shit just fucking everywhere flying at me and I can die in one hit or something I just play way better. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really dont understand why, but the harder the better for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much any game with a steep learning curve. #$%
@#$ $#@ You get used to the gameplay and also identify the flaws in design which you can exploit. #$%
@#$ $#@ A game isnt good if it starts hard and ends easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dwarf Fortress is one of those games where learning it is the most fun part out of the game though it is still damn fun when youve mastered it - sort of like your first playthrough of a Souls game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You shouldn't see learning to play the game as a hurdle to actually play it, but more of actually part of the experience #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't really want to be that guy but its only one point that is 2 different levels #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 points. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like spikes too, megaman does those well #$%
@#$ $#@ Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia. #$%
@#$ $#@ you got it #$%
@#$ $#@ But it doesn't start hard at all #$%
@#$ $#@ No, but it gets easier and easier as it goes on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone likes JRPGs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not a fan of the game getting easier as you progress but having things to do in the easier areas later is fine, like going back to kill some harder boss that's now available so all the monsters up to it will be easy #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to replay the game as it is then just replay the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ NG+ is for those who want to revisit the story but want to skip everything annoying about the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ For Adventure or Puzzle games I prefer easier initial levels with hellish later levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ With RPGs I prefer hard early games with a scaling difficulty depending on how youve built your character, I wanna be rewarded for playing smart. #$%
@#$ $#@ For action and racing games I like them to just be hard the whole way through. #$%
@#$ $#@ That just means you got average skills as a gamer. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you were really good you would feel like the medium difficulty is too easy #$%
@#$ $#@ They arnt hard to go through, but people who try dorf fort usually play without them then quit after like 3 forts without actually trying any other kind of environment. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would also be a hell of a lot more fun if it werent so insultingly easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a burden of knowledge, not a burden of skill. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just have to learn enough things to be good at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the difficulty curve is still fucking there, it doesnt just dissapear because you decided to settle in some piss easy landscape and stop playing the game there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kirby is also difficult if you dont know how to play the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you saying trial and error is hard? #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres your You. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve earned it. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, im saying that trial and error is a shitty way to implement difficulty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe you should, since you seem to not understand what ironic quotes are. #$%
@#$ $#@ a kirby game that was hard and/or more than 3 hours long would be great #$%
@#$ $#@ The thing is, there are people out there where every game is that top right graph. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had to help look after some kids and decided to show them fucking Captain Toad and collectively they could not beat the second level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably the easiest game on my shelf and they couldn't even do that, #$%
@#$ $#@ Difficulty is never objective. #$%
@#$ $#@ It depends on your innate skill, and also upon your knowledge of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats easy for some is hard for others. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kind of prefer a flatline medium difficulty with a medium-hard endgame, as well as optional hard sidequests and post-game stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ W-what kind of fun? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really, the UI and controls are a challenge at first, but it takes like 3 hours until you've got it down #$%
@#$ $#@ 30+60=90, genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ The $100+ is the collectors edition, genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, thats why I pirated GZ and am pissed off after I finished MGSV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Series should have ended at 3, Kojimas a hack. #$%
@#$ $#@ jak and daxter i win #$%
@#$ $#@ Metal Gear Solid III is my favorite game in the series #$%
@#$ $#@ How did he put the straw in #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its just shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep posting anime that's sure to get the mods' attention #$%
@#$ $#@ captain underpants was the fucking shit #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ has been the new /b/ for at least 7 years #$%
@#$ $#@ this reminds me i was watching the incredibles today and i literally had a boner while watching the mother on her suit #$%
@#$ $#@ Post more anime girls in latex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post more anime girls in domino masks. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt happen often, but sometimes the mods are off their game and /v/ likes to see how much they can get away with before they notice the board is slowly rising in porn posts. #$%
@#$ $#@ it begins #$%
@#$ $#@ im curious now #$%
@#$ $#@ RIP in pieces #$%

@#$ $#@ Then its not so boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ how can that make you depressed? #$%
@#$ $#@ it has such a happy ending #$%

@#$ $#@ Its a flower with a face Are you saying your weeb cartoon has the rights for flowers with faces? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Im sure Disney did that 70 years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please, do tell me why Im wrong in both of these points. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats an evil flower anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, there's a reasonable amount of characters, and the game doesn't rely entirely on anticlimaxes for humor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just another indie rpg with an obnoxious fanbase. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's like if someone took the ideas behind homestuck and made a second, much stronger attempt #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea, if only the MGS fanbase would fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have yet to see that movie but Ive seen Luffy punch that guy so cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like HS, there's just this one bit of music that was featured in the comic but otherwise there is absolutely no similarties. #$%
@#$ $#@ Said music originated in the Halloween Hack of Earthbound too, if Im not mistaken. #$%
@#$ $#@ This, lol. #$%
@#$ $#@ INTRODUCING SMT THE PACHINKO #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like DQXI rite? #$%
@#$ $#@ Introducing, SMT THE PACHINKO #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope it is a phone game #$%
@#$ $#@ the graphics of that teaser image scream Pachinko machine to me #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rebuy it for the vita again if it meant a graphic overhaul. #$%
@#$ $#@ they could reuse the models from DAN this time it'll feature miku #$%
@#$ $#@ Quick cashgrab with ps4 port of smt iv #$%
@#$ $#@ I would say that I wouldn't mind but then I remember that ATLUS didn't make the DLC avaiable in my country. #$%
@#$ $#@ Garbage taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ Master Edition? #$%
@#$ $#@ What, DLC on the cart? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is panchinko already dieing in japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that I should hope that it's on console or whatever but I really hope it's on 3DS #$%
@#$ $#@ So...Persona 5? #$%
@#$ $#@ it's good #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT IV is probably the best entry level Megaten right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pick it up and don't give up just because the beginning's a little difficult. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah its good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Encounters can get a bit annoying after a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's fun, but the difficulty curve is fucked to hell and the world map is a bitch to navigate without a map #$%
@#$ $#@ IS IT HAPPENING? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id be okay with this honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not sure how the fuck it would work though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a great start for the smt series and I love it, you can play Soul Hackers in the 3DS too. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only correct answer. #$%
@#$ $#@ alright thanks buds. #$%
@#$ $#@ ill see how i feel about it and if i like it ill check out devil survivor too #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think the SMT is that divisive outside Persona/Mainline debacles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of them are idorts anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ when it comes to people maybe but not the demons #$%
@#$ $#@ t-thanks walter #$%
@#$ $#@ Whichever one happened to be the cheapest because Id just end up fusing them with my dog anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt have smt in its name in Japan,which is the only place that matters. #$%
@#$ $#@ what if its a multiplat? #$%
@#$ $#@ People shit on IV for having sprites, and then there are people who shit on Nocturne and IV for not being first person, etc, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona v. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mainline is the most obvious one, but youll see the other ones pop up when people want to shit on specific mainline games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly don't see how it could continue, the story was pretty much wrapped up with 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Still Megaten #$%
@#$ $#@ That's DDS already, though #$%
@#$ $#@ Some barely connected game in another universe that uses similar concepts, I imagine. #$%
@#$ $#@ But if they do that they may as well just make a new IP thats like DDS in spirit, like KOWASHITAI but not otakushit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Battle menu. #$%
@#$ $#@ They could probably just adapt Quantum DDS. #$%
@#$ $#@ But then I haven't read it so I don't really know how well that would turn out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megaten Dancing All Night #$%
@#$ $#@ seems like a possibility #$%
@#$ $#@ Good then #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish we got a COMP User, SMT1 Hero, Aleph, Doomguy and Flynn having two costumes each. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smash uses sword and laser pistol, Special summons one demon at time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait until you fight Thor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should be just after that. #$%
@#$ $#@ But youll just trade shit emulation for shit emulation without shit filters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think it's Thor himself that's the issue, it's more the fact that you have to get through Yaksini before that, with no access to a shop or healing, only with what items and spells you have on you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have a twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better not end up being some kinda of Persona Q garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would also rather not play 3ds games anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ God that handheld sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I NEED IT #$%
@#$ $#@ OH SHIT #$%
@#$ $#@ And Europe wont get it until a year after everyone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldn't tell ya #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you fags ready to another 3 day ride? #$%
@#$ $#@ You like penises, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's two guys molesting each other behind that wall, isn't it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually plausible thanks to Persona 5, they can re-use the demon models from P5 since SMT demons are the enemies. #$%
@#$ $#@ please no #$%
@#$ $#@ It has maps #$%
@#$ $#@ We haven't seen Persona 4 Tycoon where you can manage the businesses of Inaba like Junes #$%
@#$ $#@ Take your pick #$%
@#$ $#@ This WILL happen but it will a Japanese only phone game. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is /v/ there will always be shitposting #$%
@#$ $#@ persona 3/4 #$%
@#$ $#@ Best angel deserves a spinoff. #$%
@#$ $#@ You retard Umaru poster, that number is how many retweets left until the announcement. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are currently 3515 retweets #$%
@#$ $#@ I would buy a Jack Frost. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona MMO confirmed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anons here would either stuff it up their butt or hot glue it #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Persona 5 if anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 4 3D #$%
@#$ $#@ I want it on PS4 but a vita port is the likeliest, if they put it on PS4 they'd have to basically make it a full fledged remake using the HD demon assets they now have from P5 #$%
@#$ $#@ He asked what I expect it to be for. #$%
@#$ $#@ it should be on every system that way everyone can have fun and enjoy vidya without any console war bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ That'd be retarded, it'd be exactly the same as making an entirely new game, might as well just make SMT5. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean a real MMO, like the SMT one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Built in ERP systems. #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Golden sold like hotcakes, tho #$%
@#$ $#@ partys over people. #$%
@#$ $#@ We can all go to bed now #$%
@#$ $#@ Golden outsold SMT4. #$%
@#$ $#@ but it says 3ds you mong #$%
@#$ $#@ Gale is best DDS boy. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is for the best seller version of smt4, think in atlus version of ses ultimate hits linr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play SMT ..If #$%
@#$ $#@ That's because it's Persona, not because it was for Vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ persona 1 #$%
@#$ $#@ People arent this dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's because Persona is a lot more popular than SMT #$%
@#$ $#@ Play SMT3:Nocturne, and then shit on persona. #$%
@#$ $#@ And you're done #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently they considered it but felt it didn't fit the story in p4 as well as it did in p3p or something #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuckin pick one and play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre hardly related from one game to the next. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT Nocturne is considered the best, but Digital Devil Saga is also very good, and SMT 4 is pretty decent too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its really hard to go wrong with this series. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT IV prequel? #$%
@#$ $#@ You do realize the prime consumer is a social media junkie? #$%
@#$ $#@ But Persona 2 was red #$%
@#$ $#@ Could this potentially make Black Mark canon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 1 was Megami Ibunroku though #$%
@#$ $#@ How about you check my 5? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think youre right but why use the smt4 site then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then theyll be right about it being a disaster. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt the best SMT game that would be Strange Journey, but it was still good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of the designs were truly horrendous though #$%
@#$ $#@ IV was always good, what are you talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most complains directed to inconsistent difficulties, shit plot, and weird ass demon designs #$%
@#$ $#@ That was the common opinion, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ People shilled it to high heavens until it got ported. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the only SMT games I played with consistent difficulty were Strange Journey and Nocturne on Hard Mode don't know how Normal goes #$%
@#$ $#@ No, futa angels are the best angels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its sad but true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Usually its people who only played the PS2 games doing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ DeSu 1 could pass for a mainline game if it was a dungeon crawler. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are we pretending SMT was ever popular or good? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a reason why Persona is the popular one while SMT is so unpopular they scrubbed it from the FE crossover game they're making. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you have incredibly bad taste in designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ They simply dropped the ball. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is Betatron always a thing but Sandalphon isn't #$%
@#$ $#@ No fucking clue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keita Amemiya should just stick to designing tokusatsu stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Great Bait My Man #$%
@#$ $#@ Quiet, you dumbass #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon, the Japanese are literally platform loyalists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the biggest can afford to be multiplatform devs, while every other dev is a PlayStation dev because why not, Sony has Japanese developers on a leash, their grip on the market will never EVER be contested. #$%
@#$ $#@ Follow your leader #$%
@#$ $#@ Once you start fusing Fiends Nocturne gets really easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I died 5 or 6 times in the last half of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even in my most horrifying nightmares #$%
@#$ $#@ Stoo using the word bait, you are just embarrassing yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not gonna stoo myself #$%
@#$ $#@ Decipher those runes, if you're so great #$%
@#$ $#@ Best battle theme in the entirety of mainline. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Asmodeus, it appealed to my inner edgy kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its confirmed Nintendo, just what is it exactly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing changed you fucking faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ DDS annie may when? #$%
@#$ $#@ It A-NA-RCHY #$%
@#$ $#@ Asmodeus is like Summoned Skull if Summoned Skull was designed by someone who thinks over designing something is a good idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ugh dont remind me. #$%
@#$ $#@ The port even has pay to win features #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon have you not seen all the PS4/vita games releasing in 2016 in Japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ When I say animation port, I mean more so on the quality of the Persona 3 movies that are currently coming out. #$%
@#$ $#@ LESS THAN AN HOUR FAM #$%
@#$ $#@ Be incredibly successful and world-changing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh, okay if you want me to. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonyggers BTFO #$%
@#$ $#@ Im ready for more autistic protags and anti-gravity tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fast? #$%
@#$ $#@ Where is the twitter counter? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda reminds me of the street fighter font #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy X Shin Megami Tensei #$%
@#$ $#@ FNAF x SMT?!?!? #$%
@#$ $#@ That sure explains why all Japanese developers are supporting the Wii U, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Face it, Sonys pretense in the market is not unlike what Nintendo had. #$%
@#$ $#@ They strangle the games and support out of the competition. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sony literally has a monopoly on Japanese developers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ever wondered why the Genesis had so few Japanese games compared to the SNES? #$%
@#$ $#@ Possibly FINAL. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see any numbers #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want a new game with that new sweet engine they made. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona IS SMT, stop being a bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or it will be one of the NX's first exclusives #$%
@#$ $#@ Try scrolling. #$%
@#$ $#@ It really isnt, Persona is Megami Ibunroku. #$%
@#$ $#@ He has the whole mong left arm thing going for him like lucifer as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo isnt even the publisher. #$%
@#$ $#@ you dumb nigger SMT IV is literally on sale every other week. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not even joking. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT IV Final #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt the creator of those games say he was making an RPG or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ They wouldn't make a SMT 4 "the Golden" right after saying they're doing a cheaper version... #$%
@#$ $#@ would they? #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop defending Nintendo, drones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would nintendo make a sale for a game on a sony platform? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its been 20 bucks on Amazon for quite awhile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop defending a stupid anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ So can we thank Nintendo for creating SMT? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's literally a button to add just the amount you need #$%
@#$ $#@ No face because its not happening. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMTfags on suicide #$%
@#$ $#@ doesn't effect me in the slightest #$%
@#$ $#@ While I dont agree about it being the worst that sounds like a fucking great reason to remake something. #$%
@#$ $#@ GIVE YOUR TEARS NINTENCUCK #$%
@#$ $#@ sadly, persona is already the main franchise despite naming conventions #$%
@#$ $#@ I started with IV and loved it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think DDS, Nocturne, or IV is probably a good starting point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say avoid starting on Soul Hackers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the PS2 games are on PSN. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its for Wii U? #$%
@#$ $#@ strange things are afoot at the circle K #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah right my dad works for Persona and he said it's Raidou 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ I bought it for 20 a year ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Embrace the Dark Lord and the coming apocalypse, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know it to be true. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly believe its going to be DLC. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's no reason to announce a new game when your "the best" version of the old one isn't even in stores. #$%
@#$ $#@ But that happened 10 years ago #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, youre probably right. #$%
@#$ $#@ NO FUCKING HANDHELDS #$%
@#$ $#@ But I wanna hang out with Metatron. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the best SMT #$%
@#$ $#@ Go find a spoiler free guide then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its what I did on my second playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why must man suffer like this #$%
@#$ $#@ shit you might actually be right about the words #$%
@#$ $#@ Chapter 5 is the last, then theres a short epilogue. #$%
@#$ $#@ what an incredibly short game #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even, its of average length. #$%
@#$ $#@ 10-12 hours. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kind of sounds like Machinae Supremacy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrecking shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ More like getting wrecked. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fucking demon army attack, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ so are these just all of OPs levels? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah they are all made by different people #$%
@#$ $#@ Where the hell is "Mario gets cucked"? #$%
@#$ $#@ is there really such a level? #$%
@#$ $#@ I ran out of time fighting bowser. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there something Im supposed to do to kill him fast? #$%
@#$ $#@ What are the POW blocks for? #$%
@#$ $#@ There is, and its amazing, Im not at home so I dont have the code though, search the archive. #$%
@#$ $#@ The walls in kameks level are too think. #$%
@#$ $#@ I waited around for 100 seconds to get through the first wall. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats boring as fuck man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe make them only two blocks thick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the first one is that thick. #$%
@#$ $#@ The idea was to give you time to get a feel for how Kamek works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, if you're not using the koopas/beetles shells to get through faster, that's on you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Names are hard, man #$%
@#$ $#@ Saws Galore has a really cool concept, the two fire piranha plants are kind of bullshit since by the time you see them its too late to grab a shell to kill one. #$%
@#$ $#@ One more huge flaw, is that I tanked the saws in front and just ran through the rest of the level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you tried it with autoscroll? #$%
@#$ $#@ I gave a star because the idea itself is really cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always forget you can spin jump in mario world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disregard that one complaint. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe make the wall of saws thicker or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called super cuck bros. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I guess I could do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just put a fuck load of saws after the ones at the front and have them move in the same direction #$%
@#$ $#@ Could also just require you to beat the level a second time from the checkpoint #$%
@#$ $#@ For tower of treasures, you cant see the thwomps after the second P switch until they come down breaking the blocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I felt that was a cheap death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Waluigis Condo is enemy spam: the level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not dealing with all those hammer bros again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, will give it a go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty solid level. #$%
@#$ $#@ For the bowser fight maybe use a pipe to give flowers since its easier than jumping up and hitting blocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just saying that in case the player loses the fire power too many times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice idea, I completely forgot I could spawn infinite flowers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll look into that right now #$%
@#$ $#@ What website are these posted on? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario Maker hub. #$%
@#$ $#@ Provides a nice enough interface and you can add a description. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill check it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm going to try your level now #$%
@#$ $#@ and tell me what you think about the Twomp bit Id appreciate it, the goal wasnt to make a frustrating level so Id like more feedback. #$%
@#$ $#@ This code leads to a level called Epic Ride #$%
@#$ $#@ I did a Papyrus puzzle level too; I figured for Undyne something underwater would be most appropiate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately you have it correct. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta remove it, then upload it again with the changes. #$%
@#$ $#@ You lose the course stats sadly, but any stars you earned are kept. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was intentional in case the player could take the red shell until the question block that gives out the cape. #$%
@#$ $#@ Roger that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, enjoyed the course! #$%
@#$ $#@ my b on quote and try playing levels to understand what people do wrong / what you dont find fun before making stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Undyne's Underwater Training, it was fun :3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry i was kinda drunk when i did it, hope you enjoyed it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had to make the player WANT the fire flower before they could have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ REALLY liked the Falco mission. #$%
@#$ $#@ You get a star for that one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gave you a star for it and the Yoshi level as well man. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not worth the money but I couldn't stand not having it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here, though as limited as the editor is these threads are pretty fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you liked those I think you will enjoy my others even more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grr, thanks for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna take it down and work on it #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, there is. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to remember that the game wasnt designed for you, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are kids playing the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ They probably have no idea what to do regardless of the title, and since they keep dying and the auto-play stages are super fast and chaotic, they lose hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever you do, do NOT try 100 Mario Challenge on Easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will literally be given 5-8 of those levels in a row. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am sick of it as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you anon &lt;3 #$%
@#$ $#@ you will be given certain costumes for beating easy, normal or expert. #$%
@#$ $#@ when you got all of the costumes on one difficulty youll get a notice saying to play something harder for more of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ How are these chosen? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would love to make it on this list for October. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like theres some stiff competition. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually don't know, I'm not the anon who made the pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a heads up but you can tank the chompers using the fireflower to skip the leaf part entirely. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can go into your list of recently played stages to comment without giving a star. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its ridiculous. #$%
@#$ $#@ But New Super Mario Bros U came out 3 years ago anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not touching that damn list #$%
@#$ $#@ marios physics in the old games are not represented perfectly. #$%
@#$ $#@ they all have been modified to take NSMBUs engine. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't wall jump in mario 1, you can't do all the neat tricks kaizos miss. #$%
@#$ $#@ its just NSMBU with skins. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMWs physics feel extremely close to SMW. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a job. #$%
@#$ $#@ It really should be a budget price though. #$%
@#$ $#@ basically this. #$%
@#$ $#@ never even heard of voting and whatnot and I don't think whoever even made the list even played everyone's levels and let alone mine #$%
@#$ $#@ Its definitely worth it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad I'm not poor anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was like a straw poll for a week I think before someone botspammed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think they took it down and reverted the positions to before it happened #$%
@#$ $#@ if i wanted to play levels on twitter i would go to twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ The triple homing bills right on the wall jumping segment is a bit sadistic #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 7-2 bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit's real now lol #$%
@#$ $#@ I did wind up using your gate system in a level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats miiverse, not twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does the code have any reason to be 16 inputs long? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure with a hexadecimal you could pull off an unreachably large number of combos with about 8. #$%
@#$ $#@ NSMBU feels vastly different from the other three. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario retains his momentum differently when you turn mid air and especially on the ground. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a 0000 in every level so they really should have gone with 12. #$%
@#$ $#@ my guess is the 0000s are there to eventually fill out the potential number of levels that could be submitted to nintendo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Despite my making that level intentionally bad and stupid it is my most played and starred level. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least you can go to a creators page and play them rapid fire from there. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's bad #$%
@#$ $#@ I managed to beat it but it was luck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Awesome level, dude.Starr'd #$%
@#$ $#@ Post it here, Ill play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wonderful level, great expansion on the hub world idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved all the secrets you hid around the place and pretty much all the challenges were fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Thwomp one was a bit brief and the cannon one a bit too long, but other than that they were great. #$%
@#$ $#@ The part where the giant beetle hits the sideways spring was really satisfying for some reason, cool discovery. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looked great too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll never understand what The Weeknd's hair is #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah think I overcompensated too much on the cannons when I found out you can just crouch under the giant cannons as wario without having to go into a dip #$%
@#$ $#@ Stealing one, obviously #$%
@#$ $#@ idk i was more into it to play other levels #$%
@#$ $#@ sure bb #$%
@#$ $#@ bumping for entertaining stream #$%
@#$ $#@ drop your code in the stream and they will probably play it #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill spam your codes in chat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Poor Not-Mario-Hat guy is gonna suffer, Im sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah he's not very good but at least they aren't being loud faggots like 99% of streamers #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if hes not very good, I like watching him learn. #$%
@#$ $#@ Each time he fails, he progresses a little bit more. #$%
@#$ $#@ except with this mushroom #$%
@#$ $#@ No Maebbie #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont get this meme but solidus is the best snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ OP youre all correct except swap naked and venom. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy your shitty menus. #$%
@#$ $#@ You do actually know the Metal Gear timeline, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ they used solidus corpse in mgs4 to trick them #$%
@#$ $#@ Except Solid looks fucking identical to Big Boss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Liquid was a whiny faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Clearly the worst of the clones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not saying I don't like him, but Solid and Solidus aren't crybabbies with British accents. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone update this with Venom #$%
@#$ $#@ How is he based in V you stupid cunt? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most likely another brainwashed soldier he made. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck are you smoking? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes always cared about BB, they fucking founded the Patriots together. #$%
@#$ $#@ And when the fuck were they enemies? #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally never. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes still a SJW-tier mongoloid who wants to create a world with one language and one culture, with a fascist regime controlling everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sound like a cuck to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Another faggot that BB used. #$%
@#$ $#@ Name one time Big Boss has tried to kill Zero. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt make me any less right. #$%
@#$ $#@ the wrecked eye was on the same side as solidus' on the biomort #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS4 is the game that made all of MGS3s characters into supervillians though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Solidus killed Olga #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant tell if you are seriously arguing if Big Boss in MGS4 is actually Solidus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Raiden was kind of just a crazy psycho as a kid though, and Solidus was just a puppet of the Patriots until not that long before we saw him in MGS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would basically be the adventures of discount Big Boss and mini Vamp. #$%
@#$ $#@ He also has p90 and flaming skates. #$%
@#$ $#@ Truly the best snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ How come Big Boss is 50 years old there and hasnt aged at all since Ground Zeroes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell he almost looks identical in Snake Eater. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then what causes him to age so horribly in the next 10 years? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're retarded if you think Venom was planned since MG1 #$%
@#$ $#@ They didnt replace the sprites and re-release MG1 like they did with MGS3, so yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its non-canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get this meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ His name is not even snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ You might as well call him gray fox. #$%
@#$ $#@ Says who? #$%
@#$ $#@ If Raiden counts as a Snake, The Boss should too. #$%
@#$ $#@ And arguably Miller or Gray Fox. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes basically Grey Fox 2.0 yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ GEORGE SEARS 2016 #$%
@#$ $#@ Who says it isnt? #$%
@#$ $#@ If Raiden doesnt count as a Snake neither should Venom or Big Boss. #$%
@#$ $#@ The difference being Raiden is called Snake for like five minutes, by nm AI no less. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only reason he had the codename Snake in the first place was to groom him into being a psuedo-Solid Snake and to make the start of his chapter parallel for the beginning of MGS1. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is not a Snake, hes Raiden hence why they changed his name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Deal with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if he was normal before the training, it still merely realized something that was there all along. #$%
@#$ $#@ The training didnt really make him enjoy murder and battle, the training worked because inherently he was predisposed to enjoy murder and battle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Snake is just a codename, you dense motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Raidens codename WAS at one point Snake, so he IS a Snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ His codename is Fruity Snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Raiden is a faggot and MGS2 is not canon after the tanker mission. #$%
@#$ $#@ PARASITES could still kill him if they are allowed to reach COPULATION #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you even pay attention to MGS2? #$%
@#$ $#@ Rays were mass-produced and meant to overwhelm other Metal Gears. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Solidus destroys one with his fucking P90 IIRC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uncle Phil, pls. #$%
@#$ $#@ My fuck are you retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me one legitimate reason that PW and V read; 5, FIVE, A NUMBERED GAME arent canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Subsistance/HD Camera also makes the whole game kind of a joke since your default view is so much better than the enemys and the rest of the game was not designed around this being the case. #$%
@#$ $#@ Raiden takes Rays out on foot even before his cybernetic upgrades, a whole host of them in fact, Solid needs a fucking Metal Gear Rex to stand a chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS2 had the best AI design since the environments allowed for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ front page material right here boss #$%
@#$ $#@ You have your glorious anime centered around underage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lol spotted the fuck who can't read #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a prototype. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres going to be more characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit they need some more battle music #$%
@#$ $#@ Track down a serial number for any part of TS2 and give it to their tech support. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll likely put it on your account. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Platinum games, and everything i'm seeing about this looks great, but I don't want to get hype only to get disappointed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Activision publish Call of Duty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Step up, senpai. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because this is a full fledge game with a budget behind it #$%
@#$ $#@ gon b a good day. #$%
@#$ $#@ been playing through Transformers Tataki in anticipation. #$%
@#$ $#@ It clearly states in the manual that it is gas-propelled #$%
@#$ $#@ You do realize thats how gunpowder weapons work, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're not wrong, but that's probably not what they mean. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, does the gun have a compressed gas tank that it uses to fire the bullets? #$%
@#$ $#@ You need to stop trying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gas from the explosion is what is giving the bullet the kinetic energy so yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit I remember that #$%
@#$ $#@ What else propels it but the gas from the chemical reaction of the gunpowder? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its clearly stated that the assault rifles use 7.62x51mm NATO rounds. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss the highly detailed manuals. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now games just have a slip of paper telling you to buy a different game #$%
@#$ $#@ Gas is what powers the entire mechanism of the gun #$%
@#$ $#@ They were weak against energy shields yeah they still did okay against them but that was for gameplay reason but excelled against exposed flesh, like the real things #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, and this "force", what is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is one of the reasons I almost never buy a physical copy of a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ this, oure guns and ammo are probobly relatively cheaper to make than any covy weapon. #$%
@#$ $#@ The feel of pumping a long, hard object just cant be beat. #$%
@#$ $#@ More reliable, plus I don't wanna live in a future where I can't spout one liners at aliens after pumping a round one handed into my barrel #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to bed, Shotgun Jaguar. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just checked the manual in my collectors edition of Halo 2 and yeah, its there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the books, the alien weapons are fucking devastating. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cracked the code. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit anon get to the NSA asap, they need you. #$%
@#$ $#@ never mind. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow very good, Anon, you described how current guns work! #$%
@#$ $#@ Books always made them out to be like hollow points on steroids yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish biofoam would have made an appearance in the games #$%
@#$ $#@ I never said they weren't, it's just that the kinetic force behind them would probably be less then a shard of metal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine being hit with a baseball made of fucking lava, and thats a plasma weapon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why cant we go back? #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean did it really cost that much money to have manuals be in color and have more than two pages? #$%
@#$ $#@ The pistol uses explosive bullets along with some other weapons that have specialty ammunition, but the AR uses normal bullets in the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh okay, I only played through ODST once so I didnt remember. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's been awhile since I've played any 4 killed all my desire to play the series #$%
@#$ $#@ The retcons and the direction 343 took it are not in any way appealing to me #$%
@#$ $#@ By that logic cars arent powered by gas because it uses a liquid that happens to release a gas when burnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt you know cars move forward because the gas sloshes back and forth in the tank? #$%
@#$ $#@ The exhaust is built up farts from the driver #$%
@#$ $#@ and if you really think about it, everything is made out of atoms, so everything is atomic powered #$%
@#$ $#@ Cars shouldnt even work because of Newtons second law. #$%
@#$ $#@ How can an explosion make a wheel turn? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you need proof that god exists, look at cars. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are a collection of quarks that has gained sentience. #$%
@#$ $#@ What will humans be using then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes right #$%
@#$ $#@ Well be extinct by then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Passion and talent is a rare commodity today anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ The implications that were laid out pointed to that Forerunner intermingled with ancient humans, explaining where reclaimers come from. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 went and shat all over the subtely by saying that humans were actually more advanced than the forerunners and attempted to wipe all of them out and anyone who is a reclaimer is just a forerunner. #$%
@#$ $#@ I admire your tenacity and wit anon, bravo! #$%
@#$ $#@ Either everything is sentient or nothing is sentient if you think about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ "The sound shotgun being pumped is a universal term for kiss your ass goodbye" - Some radon UNSC serviceman. #$%
@#$ $#@ You really dont know what youre talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wherever you're getting your info, I'd stop going there. #$%
@#$ $#@ halo 4 was such a fucking mess. #$%
@#$ $#@ all we got is reductio ad absurdum #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ Though the dialogue from Halo:CE implied humans were directly descended from the Forerunners, it became clear by Halo 3 that they were separate species, and that humanity were like the children of the Forerunners in that they would inherit the mantle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right so how does Humanity existing at a higher level than Forerunner at any point make sense? #$%
@#$ $#@ Like animals? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I suppose so but for stuff like plants or other things its harder to gauge. #$%
@#$ $#@ THATS WHAT THEY WROTE IN 4 THOUGH #$%
@#$ $#@ Where in Halo 3 does the lore imply that Forerunners were a different species? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats another guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree it makes no sense for them to be a more advanced civilisation than the Forerunner. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, humanity could have been more advanced than the Forerunner and STILL have been wiped out, because they were fighting a war on two fronts, not just against the Forerunners but the Flood too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right I understand thats what 343 wrote but what Im trying to say is that is really stupid and ruins the feel of the back ground to everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess I should say that 343 retconned stuff it just took it in a very bad direction #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you anon, that gives me hope. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually in the lore, plasma weapons and things like the Needler would fuck you up badly if they ever hit you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do we shove matter around or does matter shove us around? #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of old Humanity Fuck Yeah threads #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope someday some human explorers would paint that thing into a moon of a life bearing planet. #$%
@#$ $#@ The over all point Im really trying to make is that I preferred the idea that humans were not important on a galactic level during the forerunners prime at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked more before the new trilogys lore that was an over all mystery to the forerunners. #$%
@#$ $#@ What were they to humanity that kind of thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 came in and clarified everything and that took away something from the over all feel to the lore for me personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is why I really do not like what 343 did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Save 50c on every manual, on a game that sells two million copies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whoever thought letting descendants of ape creatures captain starships into battle was a good idea should be shot #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember that, it was in the halo 3 collectors edition compendium thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically they achieved industrial+ levels of technology only to nuke themselves back into retardation through infighting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree that the mystery of the Forerunners was what made them great and that making them a different species to humans was a stupid decision. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nevertheless, I thought the Forerunner books were pretty well written with a nice setting and interesting characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also preferred the first person storytelling rather than the third person storytelling in the older books. #$%
@#$ $#@ And I understand that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mystery is a good thing to have in lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only had a problem with the misinfo you were saying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being a huge halofag, my autism couldnt handle it. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is b8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Pump actions are generally preferred for for accepting various shell loads. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can we at least agree 343 is shit hole compared to old Bungie? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't remember the full details but IIRC as soon as Brutes became a space-faring species, they all dropped bombs on eachother, which wiped out nearly everything they built, thus regressing them back to tier ~7/6 on the galactic technological achievement scale #$%
@#$ $#@ could be seen as b8, how did you interpret it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ sure thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remmeber starcraft saying something like that about why they use ballistic weapons troopers, and keep hightech shit for there ships. #$%
@#$ $#@ They humen factions in that game was bland factions i ever played. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not for get how fuck up there base building is to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone who is against proper gun control is an edgy autist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you cant do that with a spas-12? #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet you smoke weed and hate the police too. #$%

@#$ $#@ just shut the fuck up already #$%

@#$ $#@ Well it apparently wasnt dominos, I cant remember when I read the story or what chain it was about, but the point kinda stands. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Fallout manuals brief nuclear physics lesson was pretty great too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gas - operated, completely different. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its about how the gun chambers another round. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a cool gif of an X ray'd AK floating around somewhere that explains it well. #$%
@#$ $#@ The needler explodes into tiny fucking shards of glass killing you and people around you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Almost, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well that's what I meant, I'm not really good at explaining shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Here is your gamercard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, remember that shitty thing Sony did to make their first console? #$%
@#$ $#@ That they partnered up with Nintendo to make the N64-disk drive, back stabbed them, and used the tech as fondation for their ps1? #$%
@#$ $#@ REMEMBER THAT SONY? #$%
@#$ $#@ PEICE OF SHTI FUCKER FUCK YOU SONY I HATE YU I WILL SHOOT UP SONY HQ SOJNY I JATE YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU #$%
@#$ $#@ I been itching to play this again for a few months but can't find a decent price for a 64 since my old one died #$%
@#$ $#@ GET OUT. #$%
@#$ $#@ the only game i consider even playing on 64 is maybe wwf no mercy with some friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you posting on a 13+ age imageboard? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ma nigga! #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought I was the only one! #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it #$%
@#$ $#@ Phones about to die so I cant post link, but, Redial from bomberman hero is pretty chill #$%
@#$ $#@ this game is what got me into drum and bass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such an amazing ost. #$%
@#$ $#@ someone told me this causes issues on a handful of the games that dont need/use it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe thats not true, but I regret not keeping the original 4mb guy around. #$%
@#$ $#@ i believe kroc yells "GET OUT" after you get the golden banana #$%
@#$ $#@ The only game known to have issues with the ram expansion is Space Station Silicon Valley. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its hard to believe only one game would be incompatible though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mars Guo was the best, everyone else was bantha poodoo. #$%
@#$ $#@ pic unrelated? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but, youre not trying to call all of those RPGs are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ My melanin guys #$%
@#$ $#@ Loved that one, was my first strategy game #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry I think I just got confused, the other guy's "Sadly, not enough RPGs on the N64" comment threw me off #$%
@#$ $#@ that game was fucking fun and surprisingly hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ getting all the high scores on missions was frustrating. #$%
@#$ $#@ he's full of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you when theyre on the 3DS? #$%
@#$ $#@ N64 and Gamecube had games other than Mario. #$%
@#$ $#@ literally gave that game away for goldeneye #$%
@#$ $#@ you first #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks for the memories anon, time to download some ROMs #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did they make it darker? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the best game available on the 64. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember this being really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ video games were good from 1980-1996 and then again from 1998-2011 #$%
@#$ $#@ I am, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if a game had at least some decent qualities to it, the fucking controller turned it into complete shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ This works with any N64 game right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Really steep price for the damn thing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill bite at the end of the year. #$%
@#$ $#@ All you need to do is remove some plastic tabs in the cartridge slot, then Japanese carts can fit in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure Everdrives go on sale on black Friday on various websites. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone needs to make a laughing Tom Cruises image of the MGS1 cast to go along this pasta. #$%
@#$ $#@ DOOM 64 #$%
@#$ $#@ I laughed at this far harder than I should have #$%
@#$ $#@ but mah guardian heroes and dragon force were sooo good #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget Shining Force #$%
@#$ $#@ Muh Bolmaukan #$%
@#$ $#@ I never thought I know this much about all the ports of RE2. #$%
@#$ $#@ DAY DINDU NUFFIN!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't think of a single time where a multiplat game had a PS1 version superior to any other version #$%
@#$ $#@ its turned based? #$%
@#$ $#@ is the attack on titan game on 3ds any good,I've never watched the anime but people say it's shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ My nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ GOAT soundtrack, too bad Voss couldn't match himself with the new tetris #$%
@#$ $#@ You do realize it only sold 50,000 copies, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, was that bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ still, is more than codename STEAM! #$%
@#$ $#@ It was released at the very end of the consoles life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Combined with poor marketing and the PS2 selling like hotcakes, it sold virtually nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah it sold like shit but there are more than 50,000 copies floating around #$%
@#$ $#@ you forgot Ogre battle 64, F-zero X, and goldeneye #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt that game rare as tits? #$%
@#$ $#@ This game is so fucking crazy, I swear to god. #$%
@#$ $#@ How wrong can one man be? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ps1 &gt; N64 #$%
@#$ $#@ That game had a stupid amount of stuff to collect honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ here's your You :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ I always thought it was weird the way you needed to get all the Tribals just to beat the game at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like its impossible to complete the game without 100%ing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shake, shake. #$%
@#$ $#@ So thats why rare ported N64 games instead of making a new game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt the Dreamcast version the best version of Gauntlet? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont speak spanish ya danm commi! #$%
@#$ $#@ And a nip nong ching chong to you too young lady. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kinda tip did you have in mind? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want that pizza. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is white pig at my door? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks brah. #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont tip in Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Here you go, anon! #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, we SHOULD nuke America again #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese pizza is fucking disgusting #$%
@#$ $#@ Not necessarily true, but its invariably INSANELY expensive. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're talking $30 a pizza, and that's for what Amerilards would consider just above a 'small' size. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm fucking getting pizza for 0.12 USD I don't give a fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ who says the guy was American? #$%
@#$ $#@ only one with 6 year old mentality is you. #$%
@#$ $#@ calm down. #$%
@#$ $#@ American spotted #$%
@#$ $#@ You're retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ yurocuck spotted #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you have an apartment to be burning down right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Gracias amigo. #$%

@#$ $#@ OH SAY CAN YOU SEEEE #$%
@#$ $#@ This meme is long dead mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop trying to bring it back #$%
@#$ $#@ Hol van a Miku? #$%

@#$ $#@ Laura thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she got revealed after Zangief, anybody would look like the second coming after him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Laura is cute, cant wait to see her Bunda in the brazil game show's trailer #$%
@#$ $#@ I love the world wide web #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a pretty impressive balance of bait and not-bait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually trying to sound helpful also improves the effect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well done. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has paler skin than Ryu. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're just trying to find excuses since you're grieving over the fact that Alex didn't get in #$%
@#$ $#@ he's too cute to be left out, capcom could do a shitton of dosh with cosmetics with him, don't worry he's coming back very soon, just imagine him back to his cvs2 glory days #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you joking? #$%
@#$ $#@ Were all mad at this. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was a thread earlier talking about how shitty ps+ is becoming. #$%
@#$ $#@ But this is a bait thread so whatever #$%
@#$ $#@ Based sony. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent defended PS+ since 2012, its fucking garbage and I only keep the subscription running because Its too much work to go out and get the games I got from the service that I actually liked. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that Sony wants everything to be crossplay just means its now even worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now even the PS3 isnt safe from the indieshit despite having a huge as fuck library that would be cheap as fuck to buy out from publishers. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only good game was rocket league #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't sound right, unlike Nintenyearold, Nintendrone, Sony Pony, etc #$%
@#$ $#@ a little better at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now this is shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats literally what i said, im "normiefag" considering games, am i supposed to be insulted by you or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you sift through the memes an cynicism on /v/ it definitely feels more honest than elsewhere #$%
@#$ $#@ Both services are clearly shit, but if youre saying thats worse than Sonys, you must be have extremely shit taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ those games are shit too though #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 shit games is worse than 6 shit games, no matter how you splice it mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention PS+ is also cheaper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously were taking about here on/v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit we could find people defending micro transactions, DRM, locked content being sold as dlc out side of here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Normies are stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Styx is pretty much the only good game that i got for free from ps+ this year tbh tbf fam lad bro bud champ friendo #$%
@#$ $#@ No and even if it had it would be worse no doubt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you born fucking yesterday? #$%
@#$ $#@ It actually was true at the time #$%
@#$ $#@ wait, so you had to give MORE money for gold on top of the xbox live subscription?topkek, thats even shittier than the current ps+ #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah on the official blog &amp; forum there are always a few uber cucks that will blindly defend literally everything sony does no matter how atrocious it is #$%
@#$ $#@ xbox 360 gwg are yours forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ xbox one gwg arent if your gold runs out. #$%
@#$ $#@ nigger, its almost half of its lifespawnconsidering that everyone is talking that this generation will be ~5 years how in the world is the ps4 still new? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't like or approve of Sony charging for online multiplayer but I can't really hold it against them when Xbox Live already proved people would pay for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just logical for a business to do it at that point. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've not heard that one before #$%
@#$ $#@ Because of licensing issues, theyre not allowed to sell older versions of the sports games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lolno all Sony consoles have had 10 year lifespans you pulled that 5 year figure literally out of your ass with no source. #$%
@#$ $#@ You do realize there is more than AAA shit and indie shit, correct? #$%
@#$ $#@ For example, JP PSN got Guilty Gear Xrd last month for PS+. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why cant the rest of the world get a good game? #$%
@#$ $#@ ayyy lmao, not the same guy, but ps3 was almost dead 6 years after its release #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd think they would keep it up indefinitely, considering how much shit they apparently went through to finally release it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're pretty deluded if you think ps3 was dead after its 6th year, it's peak sales were in its 5th year and it's still selling today #$%
@#$ $#@ Normies dont give a shit about PS+ games. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have PS+ so they can play cod. #$%
@#$ $#@ They don't even know how to work the PS store, that's why they keep "revamping" it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, for the low low price of $50 a year. #$%
@#$ $#@ For games to come on PS+ theyll have to pay a decent chunk of money. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGR:R didnt get DLC free in Europe PS3 because it went on PS+. #$%
@#$ $#@ The DLC is free in every other region and platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because nobody in their right mind could ever play more than 10 hours of Assassins Creed in a year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did your dad hit you or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a reason why youre so angry you need to tell people they should kill themselves for the stupidest reason imaginable, or are you a child? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because if thats the case, you should leave this board. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea what you and the other guy are arguing about but you should probably both kill yourselves #$%
@#$ $#@ You are just like the faggots on the Playstation blog comments that attacks everyone that says next months indieshits are anything less than stellar. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate faggots like you that jump into other people's conversations, all three of you should fucking kill yourselves #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the ps4 is still fairly new and doesn't have a large library, all of the interesting games are still selling well #$%
@#$ $#@ Been here since 2010, actually, thats why Im asking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like since TORtanic weve been invaded by children. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's becoming obvious that everyone in this thread, nay, this board should kill themselves #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone who cares played it years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those who dont, well... #$%
@#$ $#@ dont care. #$%
@#$ $#@ If /v/ mass suicided, the world would be a better place #$%
@#$ $#@ So if I grab this DriveClub thing whilst I'm still on my free trial of PS+, it'll disappear if I stop paying? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you see why Playstation loves indies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cheap ps+ fodder. #$%
@#$ $#@ not exactly disappear since you will still be able to play it when you renew, but yeah, you wont be able to play it while you arent paying #$%
@#$ $#@ If you have ps plus, you keep it, if you stop paying you lose it, but, you can get it back if you pay again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except you can't, 臭いバカ外人 #$%
@#$ $#@ Well that fucking sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess the PS4 is just going to gather more dust til Persona or Gravity Rush comes out #$%
@#$ $#@ Steamniggers will pay hundreds of dollars for games they won't ever play, just because they're on sale. #$%
@#$ $#@ Microniggers bought a fucking boner #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play £40 for one entire year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its less than the cost of one game and if you dont like it you dont pay next year #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoying that lag? #$%
@#$ $#@ So PS4 only gets ONE good PS+ game this entire fucking year? #$%
@#$ $#@ You could post this in genuinely every thread on the entire fucking site, the irony being your post would be more worthless than all the threads combined. #$%
@#$ $#@ Twisted Metal was last month and that's fuck in great #$%
@#$ $#@ I assume he is talking about Twited Metal because Drive Club sucked ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure they did at some point, I think on the Vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ he said ps4 dumbass, twisted metal is for ps3 #$%
@#$ $#@ As soon as PS4 came out and PS+ was going to be a requirement for multiplayer, I knew PS+ monthly games would be mediocre. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got ground zeroes, it's pretty shit, same with MGSV, sad to see it didn't improve at all... #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure I was still able to play GTA online when I dropped my sub #$%
@#$ $#@ you sure?isnt the main selling point of the ps+ that you cant play online without it? #$%
@#$ $#@ game don´t work after you drop PSN, I know cause I have a vita and only subbed for 3 months to get a few games like muramasa and dragon´s crown, after the sub expired, I couldn´t launch them anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, but all online "features" are free #$%
@#$ $#@ im talking about beign able to paly game that you own online, like gta, not about the ps+ games that you got while you had subscription #$%
@#$ $#@ not him BUT with Steam sales I buy cheap games that I WANT, not the shitty left overs that SONY hand picks for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ The publisher won't let it be put on plus #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask Warner brothers, same reason they are fucking stingy on putting films on shit like amazon prime #$%
@#$ $#@ I never understood how these are called free games if you pay for a service and the service gives you games. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is that free? #$%
@#$ $#@ you need it for some games, others don't bug you about it at all #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree completely. #$%
@#$ $#@ I usually get the Tuscan six cheese and occasionally load it up with meat, shits delicious. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Papa Johns but lately theyve been doing something weird with the Garlic sauce. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think they heat it up enough, or they take too long with my order because by the time it gets here its cloudy and doesnt look like the melted butter stuff I get more often. #$%
@#$ $#@ the stuffed crust is great, but then the rest of the crust is disgustingly thin and flavorless...not even like NY style thin where its delicious, just cardboard on the bottom of your pizza. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, hit me up with your store number. #$%
@#$ $#@ And please have a fresh pizza ready when I arrive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Papa John in the house! #$%
@#$ $#@ Papa John's isn't even the best chain Pizza #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve already made this thread a bit ago, why do you do it again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I do like their chicken poppers though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a fan of any big chain pizza but Hungry Howies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Their dips are fucking weird but their meatball pizza is god-tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who /MelbourneCentral/ here? #$%
@#$ $#@ sorry to hear that Chunko McFlabberfat #$%
@#$ $#@ Dominos has cinnistix and cheesy bread so you are fucking wrong. #$%

@#$ $#@ there's plenty of services that deliver mcdonalds and kfc, but don't do it man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why how bad could it be? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im so lazy I have to get someone to make food and drive it to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you honestly think Im in the mindset to get up after getting my food to microwave a tiny packet of oil? #$%
@#$ $#@ can u suck your own dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga we know its gross. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit taste good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats it like working at Nintendo Reggie? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those damp, oven conveyor, pizza chain nuggets taste of nothing though #$%
@#$ $#@ But ultra processed, breaded, and deep fried meat-like products are typically tasty. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those chicken poppers are disgusting. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I wanted fast food chicken, Id get KFC or Popeyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Papa Johns is fucking teriible for pizza, go get some Mountain Mike's #$%

@#$ $#@ ugly horse-faced slut. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes super cute, but shut the fuck up, OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice projecting fatty, your waifu is still a horsefaced whore. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was her and it was possibly the most awkwardly acted kiss i've ever seen #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck I want that costume. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck was the drama even about? #$%
@#$ $#@ As far as I know its a japanese war drama full of white people #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet GaB did this #$%
@#$ $#@ You are a meatball piloting a bone-mech inside fleshy armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck could they collaborate on? #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, I wouldn't hate Arin so much if it weren't for the fact that people still suck his dick and think he's relevant even after Jon left his sorry ass and doing nothing but trying to keep GameGrumps afloat since he doesn't even do animations anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCKING KILL MYSELF STEF HOW COULD YOU #$%
@#$ $#@ The fucks with his facial hair? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its even worse than Deans Whos admittedly a handsome bastard, shit beard aside. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats what happens when you marry an ayylien #$%
@#$ $#@ He would if he wasn't kill ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't look much better without it #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant wait for the shitstorm this will cause. #$%
@#$ $#@ she played us like a damn fiddle. #$%
@#$ $#@ She probably saw "Quiet" and realised they were westerners and were going to tell her about how sexist the character is #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE ON THIS BOAT JONTRON #$%
@#$ $#@ impure thoughts are not allowed in /joost/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Tell that tease to stop exposing her rather excellent midriff, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably 'cause extreme tans were more fashionable in the mid-late '00s than they are now. #$%
@#$ $#@ whos the dude #$%
@#$ $#@ Pic unrelated of course, all I see is a horse. #$%
@#$ $#@ not him, but she didn't really start getting attractive until she was in her early 20s tbh, good physique-aside #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if she was "weird", she was clearly hot, so she would have been invited to SOME parties. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously just so guys could get with her but still. #$%
@#$ $#@ Invited =/= actually attending, of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ don't bro you're ruining neckbeard dreams #$%
@#$ $#@ Stef is here to make you want to be a better person, so you can go outside and find your very own joost #$%
@#$ $#@ Like Venom Joost #$%
@#$ $#@ I better start heavily investing my autismbux in cloning #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know whether the fact she spent the entirety of her 21st and 22nd birthdays having cupcakes and tea with her parents and brother as opposed to hanging out with her friends is something to cringe or say "D'aw" at. #$%
@#$ $#@ The novelty of going out and getting so smashed you dont differentiate between your face and ass wears off pretty quickly anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus, once you have adult friends, theyre maybe busy if your bday is during the weekday. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant even remember the last time i celebrated my birthday. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not something i look forward to. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound sad anon, have some Joostfeet™ #$%
@#$ $#@ Head tracking will be a thing, but everything else is a gimmick. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you stay with her, youll starve to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ And she wont even care. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she isnt real. #$%
@#$ $#@ VR will be around for a while as a niche product like flight sticks. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will absolutely not be the next big thing in gaming, but itll hopefully still be supported by enough devs to make ownership worthwhile. #$%
@#$ $#@ I said about real flight trainers #$%
@#$ $#@ Professional flight sims already use collimated displays that are far better than any VR though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those dont allow for depth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre not VR and are only better in some ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ blondie is better #$%
@#$ $#@ PC Western version would have you in your shed watching your waifu being enriched by Jamal and Tyrone. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fight for this future. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only vr worth mentioning will be artigicial academy type games with fleshlightattachments with built in semen tray collectors and vibrators. #$%
@#$ $#@ Captain?W hat is AR? #$%
@#$ $#@ Meh, string of cold fish.. #$%

@#$ $#@ there is a rigorous test you must first complete. #$%
@#$ $#@ post your ign in here or message someone in game. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you can complete that task, youve earned your place. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn that is a hard one man idk if im worthy of it. #$%

@#$ $#@ Played maple for 10 years bud if you need something more casual then post bb better off playing candy crush. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty buggy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make sure youre running as an administrator, restart your computer, and if the problem persists, upload a screenshot here. #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont trust this guy either #$%
@#$ $#@ all opinions discarded #$%
@#$ $#@ Going back to an old version ps doesn't magically make the community revert as well sorry to burst your bubble #$%
@#$ $#@ the feels are returning now #$%
@#$ $#@ I used to like them back when I was first playing the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now it's never worth it and just annoying #$%
@#$ $#@ World tree has some of the most interesting bosses in the game #$%
@#$ $#@ Vellum is annoying #$%
@#$ $#@ its pretty neat. #$%
@#$ $#@ as someone who grew up with maple and still played a bit post-bb, mapleroyals just feels more authentic than gms nowadays. #$%

@#$ $#@ The thing about the AI is that its supposed to die after a certain time has passed, and otherwise it plays perfectly, so unless if you get really lucky the AI will only get hit when it decides to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aya and Medicine fuck up the AI so it gets hit even when its not supposed to yet. #$%

@#$ $#@ Try changing your resolution from windowed to fullscreen and vice versa on the custom.exe in your game folder #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a forced lesson of git gud. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you say they phased out of existence? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would if I wasn't so shit at them #$%

@#$ $#@ pic related #$%
@#$ $#@ Hearthstone, Darkest Dungeon, HoMaM3, any Civilization game, if you're point&amp;click adventure fan, then Sam&amp;Max games or Monkey Island games #$%
@#$ $#@ idk, whole game was comfy for me #$%
@#$ $#@ I have the same thing with Dark Souls, since ive already beaten like 100 times i can get comfy with the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark Souls to for that matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno why I feel some comfy while playing #$%
@#$ $#@ this tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Sunless Sea is quite chill #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ told me banished is shit because once you get the "formula" the game becomes easy meaning theres nothing that changes up the gameplay - true? #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you doing right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn man. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could try Tropico 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Second this comfy as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Being a truck driver has always been my fallback career. #$%
@#$ $#@ Soon automated cars will take all the jobs. #$%
@#$ $#@ i can just tell thats a facebook game by looking at the picture #$%
@#$ $#@ same ive always romanticised the idea of long hauling it across country listening to music. #$%
@#$ $#@ just cost too much to start up. #$%
@#$ $#@ People havent even automated fast food yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ If people still fuckin drive trains, then you better believe theyre still gonna be hiring truck drivers in 20 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a new thing for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ They need to bait people, so first/first two month rewards should be good #$%

@#$ $#@ Thanks, gonna milk my cock while thinking of you now. #$%
@#$ $#@ it isn't a crime against elves, they aren't human #$%

@#$ $#@ what the fuck did you just say to me #$%
@#$ $#@ For some reason all the mods have a seizure right now dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought I was the only person with one of those. #$%
@#$ $#@ she looks too old tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ People are evolved to automatically get horny when they see these things. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes us sexually competitive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats an incubus, you unlearned teen. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Selim doesnt even have a big butt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes hot and all, but I would only use him for threesomes if I already had the other bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within plays a lot like a tabletop game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even being ironic about it, that Neptunia game was true kusoge #$%
@#$ $#@ I live half a country away from you, what are you doing here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn it when are we getting another Sailor Moon game? #$%
@#$ $#@ My dad is a centrist urbanite and still thinks this shit is weird. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully not before Japan gets over the shitty musou adaptation meme its currently experiencing. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are tons of games that have cute girls but also good gameplay, why dont you play those? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre all on Vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her pose reminds me of sassy black lady. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much every JRPG and every Japanese fighting games have cute girls #$%
@#$ $#@ The nep games would be perfect as VNs. #$%
@#$ $#@ He mustve been terribly disappointed and kicked you out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Atelier is pretty much the best cute girl video game, because the series is great even without focusing on the protags #$%
@#$ $#@ They may as well be with as easy as the combat is. #$%
@#$ $#@ ReBirth 1 True Ending Arfoire. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like any Nep would let you near them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ram against her will while Rom and Blanc are tied and to the wall and forced to watch #$%
@#$ $#@ Great taste #$%
@#$ $#@ that's a bitch, not a sassy blacklady #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to beat you up irl dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ not canon #$%
@#$ $#@ Id anally violate Nep. #$%
@#$ $#@ As someone who lives in redneckistan I can say I love animu. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Im probably the exception here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of that dip, truck, beer, hunting shit is true. #$%
@#$ $#@ A person drew it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would still violate though #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, and tell me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would anyone who lives there be more or less likely to enjoy it, than say an urbanite on a per 100 people scale? #$%
@#$ $#@ TBH fam with social media theres not that much difference between us and city folk these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ No matter how cute this shit is, I will never buy another nep game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre undeniably shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The autism required to drag your face through a game is beyond me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you sleeping in the same bed as your mom #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont call it that for nothing boyo. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't sleep there, I just get this urge to get in the bed while she's on it and play some cute games and answer her questions about the cute games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, Im a pampered faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, what a pampered faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you go in your moms room to play games? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just seems weird to me, I never go in my mom's room and she never enters mine #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh OK, basically you and your mom just treat her room like a living room #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes and now that I think of it, our actual living room is fucking useless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice projection, I already have a son. #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried PP, because 15 bucks fuck it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt care for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very but Id rather they just adopt. #$%
@#$ $#@ My mom is not for lewding up. #$%
@#$ $#@ When is the third one coming to steam? #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon stop I already said lewd things never happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too shy and I would also feel bad for leaving my mom for a younger girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id break her heart. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I have a plan now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow I think I have a goal that isnt perfecting Sadistic Music Factory in front of mom now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really appreciate this anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did at one point, then 2009 happened. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although, if wifey disapproves you may have to have her sleep on the floor until she learns to appreciate cute girls doing cute things. #$%
@#$ $#@ That, or spank her in front of the tv with Wakaba girl on full blast and repeat until she cant hear pin pon hajime without her butt getting sore. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am the same age and have a sister the same age. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish shed play vidya with me instead of hanging out with her sorority sisters. #$%
@#$ $#@ How does it get interesting? #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant fuck her anymore? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah if my sister has son's I'll probably do the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well memed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot my nep-related image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Snuggling with baby half brother and step sister while playing my miku game should come close at least #$%
@#$ $#@ The Rebirth games and Fairy Fencer F are both shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're not good games but they're enjoyable and simple with just enough interesting mechanics so that you stay interested. #$%
@#$ $#@ I find it hard to put them down. #$%
@#$ $#@ they're like B-movies, they're clearly bad but no offensively so. #$%
@#$ $#@ No PS3 with you? #$%
@#$ $#@ The only PS3 game that was shit was the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ RB2 and 3 are pretty much the exact same games as their PS3 counterparts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does anyone here even actually care about the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh man you make my day that fucking OP #$%
@#$ $#@ Normie pls #$%
@#$ $#@ Closer to BUY FUCKING LIFE RINGS #$%
@#$ $#@ That shits expensive though and I need to save up money for my dress up clothes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Exactly what makes him a normie? #$%
@#$ $#@ Save costumes for later, much later, if you are playing on PC you can always use Cheat Engine to make money. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also in fight keep characters at some distance from each other since bosses almost always have some sort of AoE so if you put all neps in one place they all get raped #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish he did, but he died 2 weeks ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT GAME #$%
@#$ $#@ Artificial academy 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ So is the new one better or the first one? #$%
@#$ $#@ For all the negative things that AA2 had, good lord did it look a hundred times better than AA1 #$%
@#$ $#@ definitely true in my experience #$%
@#$ $#@ Define "negative things". #$%
@#$ $#@ The main catch of this game was that you could insert whoever you wanted in it, wasnt it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that AA2? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont remember that animation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you fug her #$%
@#$ $#@ Wtf blue board dude #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this guy, like, filming himself across several different hotels just to catch the reactions of the maids if its the same guy, not a dick conoisseur here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because thats messed up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not true in my experience. #$%
@#$ $#@ My sister is pure and only loves other pure girls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even most 2D girls can match her purity, plus shes super cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if this would have gone down differently had this guy been an attractive 20 year old with a well formed penis. #$%
@#$ $#@ This has to be the most pathetic thing Ive ever watched. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, so her hate of men makes her pure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, ok. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is it messed up? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you such a prude? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait what that faggot comes to 4chan? #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks obama #$%
@#$ $#@ he posts on /gif/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fucking flashing if anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop being such an insufferable faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a god damn penis #$%
@#$ $#@ Hello Zoe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Arent there move virgin men than women when you reach a certain age? #$%
@#$ $#@ That is what it seems like around me and on websites dedicated to finding relationships or just sex. #$%
@#$ $#@ my sister said shes saving herself for marriage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently her bf is totally fine with that but he lives in germany so I dunno maybe he cheats when he goes home for the summer. #$%
@#$ $#@ You shouldnt let your sister marry into islam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Chad bring his best friend Tyrone over too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Aw shucks you got me anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Chad got Tyroned and left me to deal with Chad's Now Stanley's whining. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sisters are sluts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Double true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Despair but also an erection #$%
@#$ $#@ Not hard to be successful if you use your vagina #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you just notice that? #$%
@#$ $#@ There are more virgin men at every age after puberty. #$%
@#$ $#@ QUICKLY POST CHAIRS #$%
@#$ $#@ Do people really jerk off to this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you jerk off to anon #$%
@#$ $#@ there are people in this world that jerk off to literal shit anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you try out her pussy? #$%
@#$ $#@ You and I both know the only reason she got her position is because she fucked every boss shes had. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want niggers to leave #$%
@#$ $#@ this is why western society needs to burn #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're not a nigger you're not even worth talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ feels good man. #$%
@#$ $#@ then why arent you the girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because being fat is not okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its unhealthy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if it's not your fault you are fat some illness or something it doesn't make it less unhealthy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's not mocking someone for something they can't control; they did it to themselves and they KNOW it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or at least they should. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could probably change being gay too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think fat can be cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Statistically, less than 5% of obese people can blame that shit on genetics. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other 95% are just lazy fucks, and therefore have no one to blame but themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just cant stop thinking about tits #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you pretending you don't talk about women's bodies here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Bara fags are disgusting #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if the majority of people that dislike barafags are overweight and/or manlets #$%
@#$ $#@ I would but her ass smells pretty ripe on day 2 and I can't get enough #$%
@#$ $#@ Majority of bitches only care about pussyeating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless you have some micropenis shit going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know how you came to that conclusion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bara is disgusting because fatties and especially fat furries are disgusting #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree but when a girl loves your lack of will power and body whats not to like? #$%
@#$ $#@ She can be pretty mean though but never about my weight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well the most effective way is probably feeding them more :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ I lost my virginity to a chubby guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't go to school tomorrow normie #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont go to school. #$%
@#$ $#@ your neet ass will never be capable of paying her back and she only stopped because you have no will to do anything on your own you fucking kike #$%
@#$ $#@ Being black is a choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, being white is a choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not the other way around. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is video games anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not even curvy, that's a perfect, slim body with a nice ass and tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Curvy fits in between those two pictures, enough cushion to enhance the ass, tits and thighs without hurting the stomach or neck. #$%
@#$ $#@ go to med school, brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats how i plan on repaying my big bro back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah pretty much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hows your war vet grandpa doing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Visit his grave lately? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, you got me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im already deep in CS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill probably have to go abroad to make a good living. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a friend that does programming for a university in england and gets something like 3000 pounds a month just for research. #$%
@#$ $#@ the project had something to do with Civil Engineering. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont be a fucking bitch cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ say what you want to say and let the words fall out honestly...... #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking disgusting, faggots like him are the reason feminism exists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post a vocaroo, you lewd boy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Venom is arguably a better BB than the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ocelot pushes you away in the mother base tutorial if you walk into him too anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ doesnt come out till the 6th anon ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ How so? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought he was a poorly executed character. #$%
@#$ $#@ The plot could have explored the body double aspect of his being and it just... #$%
@#$ $#@ He was a mute stand in that mostly served as an ear for other characters to monologue into. #$%
@#$ $#@ Venom was a bad character. #$%
@#$ $#@ No doubt about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ there were hints dropped everywhere so it wasn't a big problem #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm hoping it's downloadable at midnight #$%
@#$ $#@ Guessed it since 2013. #$%
@#$ $#@ which is about 20 hours away still so yea ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ At least you dont have a essay due on the 6th. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGO3 will be my reward for finishing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have job interview that day. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope I dont get it. #$%
@#$ $#@ He never asked for this, BB set him up to go do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like Solid Snake, his expectations for anyone thats not his waifu is so fucking low hes constantly getting blown the fuck out as an old man. #$%
@#$ $#@ 6.5 inches so pretty much just average, maybe a little below. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ The protagonists had more and more personality up until TPP. #$%
@#$ $#@ 6.5 INCHES IS NOT FUCKING AVERAGE. #$%
@#$ $#@ SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 5 AND 5.5. #$%
@#$ $#@ 6.5 IS PRETTY FUCKING BIG #$%
@#$ $#@ Where at? #$%
@#$ $#@ The twist really grew on me, especially because of the way it sheds new light on MG1, where big boss essentially became the thing he hates - a manipulative coward who sends his own men to die for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its kind of relieving to have been spoiled, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id hate to think how fucking furious I would have been had I played the game for its entirety only to have the twist thrown at my face as an afterthought. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series creator certainly did. #$%
@#$ $#@ car wash anon #$%
@#$ $#@ You just feel sorry for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel sorry for Venom, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry that's he's such a poorly utilized character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Medic-kun just awoke from a 9 year coma, cut him some slack. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice, perfect score. #$%
@#$ $#@ The first injury he had was on his one remaining arm, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you expect him to use a plastic hook hand to be able to set a bone back in place, especially when he's so atrophied that he couldn't even walk at the moment? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but if you take into account Elis apparent victory over Venom it just shows that the method is inefficient. #$%
@#$ $#@ In a way it worked out then, because you end up hating BB anyway after seeing all the good Venom did. #$%
@#$ $#@ too bad it went nowhere with it #$%
@#$ $#@ But he needed Liquids LUST FOR REVENGE in order to fuck shit up. #$%
@#$ $#@ the boss ai says youre not jack #$%
@#$ $#@ Flawed recessive genes or not, DNA would still match up if it was him. #$%
@#$ $#@ you mean the three words he say in the whole game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, who was his voice actor? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's why I didn't write "recessive" in my post. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disappointing everyone misses this. #$%
@#$ $#@ David Hayter, of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who else could voice Snake? #$%
@#$ $#@ Venom was done the same way Paz and Ocelot. #$%
@#$ $#@ was it hypnotherapy? #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it cause it justified his new appearance. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was a different big boss, so he had a different haircut, different voice actor, different eyepatch, scars, shrapnel, he never talks, or wears the bandana. #$%
@#$ $#@ then, what about Ground Zeroes? #$%
@#$ $#@ But BB had the same voice. #$%
@#$ $#@ They didnt even make it hayter for the real BB TPP. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking hate this kind of shit... #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that Liquid went jackal hunting is still pretty awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ And even if he wasnt a commander for the SAS, being a member of it at such a young age is pretty badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then he went on to become FOXHOUND commander when BB wasnt paying too much attention to the list of names. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you abort the mission after extraction or finish it? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just a diversion to hide the fact that they're going to be putting out a shitty broken game #$%
@#$ $#@ PITCH A MEME #$%
@#$ $#@ BLEEPIE BLAAOOPIE #$%
@#$ $#@ this is hilarious #$%
@#$ $#@ Also YLYL material #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing is I think he shills his own posts here #$%
@#$ $#@ Post the edit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure it's satire, and his statement saying it's not satire is also satire. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact somebody got assmad and made that poll is cringe in itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats with those fucking teeth? #$%
@#$ $#@ oh god no please #$%
@#$ $#@ For a second I thought that was pig latin. #$%
@#$ $#@ So are Undertalefags the newest autistic fanbase? #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes sense after the 10th watch. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is funny what the fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you! #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I can finally leave this thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ explain this to me #$%
@#$ $#@ EHKO DA HETCHHAG?!?!? #$%
@#$ $#@ sorry but this shit is hilarious #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt prepared for this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how he doesnt even explain why he dislikes Mario. #$%
@#$ $#@ He just says that Sonic is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Made by a retard who thinks its his duty to educate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone needs to hit a man with glasses. #$%
@#$ $#@ This makes me want to smoke more out of spite #$%
@#$ $#@ this guys channel is fucking hilarious #$%

@#$ $#@ Maybe getting told to clean something up was his Berserk Button. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ some bitch playing an xbox 360 indie game? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was either a very obvious joke, or an average anime plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not okay anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ holy fuck dont remind me #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, not to be jacking off our own horn, but anyone jaded enough to habitually frequent boards other than /b/ is usually tired of facebook shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone know the source to the gay porn musical song #$%
@#$ $#@ It's pretty clear that he's kidding in these videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's got confidence you don't see from the typical, cringe-worthy autists you see on Youtube. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus, he hits the mark too perfectly on being the epitome of retarded autistic weeaboo. #$%
@#$ $#@ well, wouldnt YOU stab someone if they stole a pastry from you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those fucking teeth bruv #$%
@#$ $#@ Saw this during the fucking Falcons game. #$%
@#$ $#@ THREE FUCKING TIMES #$%
@#$ $#@ some people have twins #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you think of these people that describe themselves like that, would YOU describe yourself in a similar manner? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ These truth campaign ads are so fucking pretentious it hurts #$%
@#$ $#@ Truth as in Truly Bad #$%
@#$ $#@ its definitely satire. #$%
@#$ $#@ His Dark Souls video ought to have tipped you off to that #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure it's the second option. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why live? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to smoke now. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is the reason children smoke. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm in hell amen't I? #$%

@#$ $#@ Thank god Troper Tales hasnt been a thing for years. #$%
@#$ $#@ You need to stop ruining plot twists in your videos recommending a show #$%
@#$ $#@ Olivia Jensen #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember watching this like 5 years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats a brojob #$%
@#$ $#@ I've never smoked in my life but this makes me want to smoke at least a pack a day every day until the day I fucking die #$%
@#$ $#@ Not bad anon, above average in terms of youtube shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like listening to dialogue in Magicka. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit, it all makes sense #$%
@#$ $#@ I will never understand why people ever find these guys attractive. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was great anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like that guy who delitizes characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a cool dude, but theres no hiding the fact that hes a bit of a sperg. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasn't even good cringe it was just sad how autistic this kid is #$%
@#$ $#@ Dear god what the fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ i was there 2015-2015 #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't this Quiet's character if you replace the peanut butter with water, though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Normies are just so fucking strange sometimes, I don't get how we're always considered the weird ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant stop watching these videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also passion fruits look like cases of boogers. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what triggers me? #$%
@#$ $#@ People using the words "implying" IRL. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same goes for when people said "EL OH EL" IRlL. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like if its funny then fucking laugh. #$%
@#$ $#@ A friend of mine tried to pull it off 11 years ago and it didn't work, but I'm sure you can today. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was, he made a thread for it too. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was great. #$%
@#$ $#@ id pay money to lick all that peanut butter off of her #$%
@#$ $#@ I laughed at just how fucking stupid this is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some fucking old man in a board meeting thought this would stop people from smoking #$%
@#$ $#@ They were at least smart enough to purge that entire feature from the site for all eternity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do all heavily autistic people have such similar faces? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah nah, I lost after 2 seconds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do faggots, degenerates and retards have to enjoy the things I enjoy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes got an autistic face but a fine body. #$%
@#$ $#@ the self contained salt #$%
@#$ $#@ You might be right. #$%
@#$ $#@ But this is still too disturbing to imagine, what if he doesnt get more friends because of a vagina? #$%
@#$ $#@ What if he is isolated out of the community for being the same freak he was before? #$%
@#$ $#@ In the end its just the same Chris with a vagina. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know whether to laugh or be annoyed #$%
@#$ $#@ Which has the more autistic fanbase, undertale or sonic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hands down. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am dying of laughter, I cant believe some of the shit in this thread even exists. #$%
@#$ $#@ eh, hes pretty annoying #$%
@#$ $#@ You ok anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because some people deserve threats of violence, and watching what you say is for insecure betas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Undertale has some okay fans as of now. #$%
@#$ $#@ We just need longer to sit in our filth. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're both shit, but at least star fox and animal crossing aren't soulless indie garbage cashins. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you nigga, I watched all your videos and I want more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not an SJW actually, and pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would marry her. #$%
@#$ $#@ you are the problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Late to thread and likely a bait reply given cropped porn image, but the issue with the comic is a guy is telling people not to call eachother names and to watch their language while simultaneously swearing like a sailor and calling people names. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait whats wrong with liking Ratchet Deadlocked? #$%
@#$ $#@ They havent learned. #$%
@#$ $#@ In the 90s, they tried to convince kids with shitty rap. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now theyre using shitty memes. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks I worked half an hour in ms paint for this.. #$%
@#$ $#@ the white inside the letters are triggering me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not a terrible way of looking at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd be inclined to agree really that said I've only ever games on consoles except fot old RTS games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But what if I dont want a PC since it doesnt have games Im interested in on it? #$%
@#$ $#@ wait where is the case? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's going to be a port of IV since it's on its website. #$%
@#$ $#@ 5000 tweets have already occurred since the site was put up. #$%
@#$ $#@ 5000 have been made already dumbass #$%
@#$ $#@ That F could be a P, note how theres something beside the N #$%
@#$ $#@ IV's already getting a new release in Japan, I don't think they're going to flood the market with it #$%
@#$ $#@ Shin Megami Tensei FINAL #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, there's a hashtag in moon #$%
@#$ $#@ It will be a mobile port. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT 1 &amp; 2 are already on mobile, and 4 is definitely doable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please be vita only. #$%
@#$ $#@ because I've been watching it for the last 2 and a half hours you fucking retard #$%
@#$ $#@ At least this fucking retard didnt waste his time like that you fucking retard #$%

@#$ $#@ That's wrong though #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the thread and stop asking dumb questions. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT Nocturne #$%
@#$ $#@ Masaki pls go. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the secret easter eggs on DMC 2 brah #$%
@#$ $#@ no it isn't #$%
@#$ $#@ that would be actually good #$%
@#$ $#@ Go and hit the books and make friends while you still can kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise you might end up in jail for shooting up some school in the middle of nowhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ it is 8943 for me #$%
@#$ $#@ Nocturne or IV, assuming you mean SMT. #$%
@#$ $#@ For non-SMT Atlus RPGs try Digital Devil Saga or Persona 3 FES. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off shitposter #$%
@#$ $#@ They add up to 15000. #$%
@#$ $#@ You two are looking at posts till now and posts to go respectively. #$%
@#$ $#@ Devil Survivor is nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC2 Dante best Dante tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Nocturne is piss easy too, it just was the first MegaTen for a lot of people. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think SMT I was actually easy, it just had the worst balance in any RPG I have ever played. #$%
@#$ $#@ FIGHTING NOCTURE ALL-STARS #$%
@#$ $#@ Oooh, are we nuking New York now? #$%
@#$ $#@ oh I see, you're ok anon #$%
@#$ $#@ HOYS SOON MY FRIEND #$%
@#$ $#@ You idiots know its going to be a port, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why its on the SMTIV website, it isnt a new game announcement. #$%
@#$ $#@ it could be an R too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pachinko it is #$%
@#$ $#@ No big deal. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would imagine most people who play a lot of Atlus games are idorts anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe it's you stop avatarfagging people might be more willing to help #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off back to /jp/ #$%
@#$ $#@ what smt was ever ported to IOS? #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT I and II are on iOS with official translations #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even that guy but,I think you need to understand what avatarfagging means #$%
@#$ $#@ 1, 2 and If #$%
@#$ $#@ Based on how these answers have varied is it safe to assume the games arent connected and I can jump in almost anywhere I please? #$%
@#$ $#@ So theyd rather port it to retarded iphonefags who would never enjoy the game, instead of remaking it for the 3ds? #$%
@#$ $#@ Some anon asked how to get into SMT and got a bunch of replies, go read them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would be totally be ok with this on the condition that atlus starts bringing the rest of them overseas. #$%
@#$ $#@ the storylines aren't connected for the most part #$%
@#$ $#@ only one was translated and japan love their mobile ports #$%
@#$ $#@ Most Megami Tensei games, even the numbered Shin Megami Tensei games take place in different universes. #$%
@#$ $#@ im ready #$%
@#$ $#@ Top number is tweets left. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bottom number is total tweets so far. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's shit, slowdowns and glitches everywhere #$%
@#$ $#@ Disable adblock to see it #$%
@#$ $#@ Only played the first so far and no. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has framerate issues and audio desync up the ass in most cutscenes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Emulate or play it on an actual PS2 if you can. #$%
@#$ $#@ what is supposed to be tweeted? #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as the new memes are dank, Im all for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ when you click the tweet button, it highlights everything you don't need #$%
@#$ $#@ You just mad for sake of being mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fail to see that. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was only one person asking and not how to get in, but what is SMT in a first place. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had audio on cutscenes out of sync with DDS 1 and 2, same with fusing demons in Raidou 1 an 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not sure about Nocuture. #$%
@#$ $#@ With a little tweaking they all run better emulated on PC #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, well my dad works at Atlus and he told me its Soul Hackers 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ That would install the demon summoning program, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait a sec, I think I have the full "Anarchy" wallpaper somewhere what will be revealed behind the cracks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure they just change the picture manually so it has no chance to leak #$%
@#$ $#@ Most likely because Sony took all of its IPs away from it to bolster the portstation4 lineup. #$%
@#$ $#@ i want to fuck ingrid #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not an A #$%
@#$ $#@ The cracked wall shakes when you click it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt notice that before. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would rather play a decent RPG with bad graphics than a talking simulator with a halfassed RPG minigame #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want to slap that booty #$%
@#$ $#@ Personafags are the fucking worst, Nocturne is the best JRPG of the PS2 it deserves a proper sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shame you just get bad graphics with SMT IV #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 2 also had an American #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not DDS 1-2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still better than "talk to your virtual friends for 60 hours with 5 hours of RPG gameplay" #$%
@#$ $#@ But you would have to make contracts with feminists if it was like SMT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your tears sustain me. #$%
@#$ $#@ im a fatlus-fag so i love the megaten series as a whole #$%
@#$ $#@ there was no Persona 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ At least #FE is a real JRPG, and not a walking/dating sim #$%
@#$ $#@ Where do you think you are exactly? #$%
@#$ $#@ It might feel dated to some, but its a solid game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank god all the shitty ramen we eat lets us drink his delicious salt water. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just dont use Bufu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this an inside joke in the game or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ They even hate their fanbase like valve does #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends, do you like oldschool RPGs? #$%
@#$ $#@ If not then no if yes then yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ SHIN MEGAMI ┴ENSEI V CONFIRMED #$%
@#$ $#@ it's old, but fun #$%
@#$ $#@ the strong triumph over the weak #$%
@#$ $#@ Play the Japanese PS1 version, the 3DS version is buggy as fuck and crashes and loses save data. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would i be mad if i could play an idol RPG on PS4? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also if you support #FE you are killing SMT. #$%
@#$ $#@ what about jap version?Like is it a shoddy translation that causes it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The leap from last gen to this one is probably the smallest one so far. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck are you talking about, wiiu even with their small numbers of instal base, buy more games than the ps4 cucks, every game released and advertized for wiiu in the last months has sold over a million mario maker its over 1.4 millions now #$%
@#$ $#@ Atlus is killing SMT. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT will remain in handheld hell while they make a big budget idol game with FE characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Strange Journey is the best SMT??? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you like first person dungeon crawlers and SMT give it a try. #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoyed it but its definitely dated as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would suggest checking out a gameplay video or two. #$%
@#$ $#@ go on. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other images arent online yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are replacing it whenever they hit certain milestones. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Splatoon has outsold or about to out sell Bloodbourne despite the Wii U having the smaller userbase, kek. #$%
@#$ $#@ already tried looking around and couldnt find anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon the best SMT is on a handheld. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like you were too late! #$%
@#$ $#@ Nowhere in my post did I mention the 3DS. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was saying your examples dont match up to current tech. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why even bring PS4 into the discussion you defensive drone? #$%
@#$ $#@ Idolshit will not sell on the system. #$%
@#$ $#@ They manually update it. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game was the reason why we have so many retards who dont uderstand law and chaos and think that neural path is the best! #$%
@#$ $#@ I had same SMT IV did more damage to alignments that SJ had. #$%
@#$ $#@ No that was SMT 1 where going chaos or law fucked you straight in the butt because demons of the opposite alignment did jack shit agains either Asura or Michael #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry i mean SMT IV damaged people perception of alignments more than SJ did. #$%
@#$ $#@ This will be a last push for me to buy a vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ we are not talking about consoles speed reader, its about sold games, fucking splatoon its outselling bloodborne #$%
@#$ $#@ Will he ever come out of the flower fields? #$%
@#$ $#@ HEE HO #$%
@#$ $#@ those are the numbers for the countdown #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey man, STEAM was a good game. #$%
@#$ $#@ he already has #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think it did yet, Bloodborne still has more sold but not by too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Law was actually pretty reasonable, in the end the angels and demons both fucked off and Mikado was at peace. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT'S GOING ON #$%
@#$ $#@ it changes the background image when the tweet goal reaches a number hence background image #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats he doing now anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Atlus fire him? #$%
@#$ $#@ Froms Souls series is far from niche anymore though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah lets just forget about that part where Exterminatus was applied on Tokyo. #$%
@#$ $#@ i agree bro xD #$%
@#$ $#@ He's in management now I think #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a shame, he deserves to be free among the flowers with his demon brethren. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck, this retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ BB was heavily marketed and the series is anything but fucking niche. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Dark Souls games alone not even counting DeS have sold more than 8 million. #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the thread faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ It didnt had a happy ending, otherwise Aigis and Liz would had accepted it from the start. #$%
@#$ $#@ ATLUS is trying to make the ending happy. #$%
@#$ $#@ How out of the loop are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ They just finished doing exactly that for P5 #$%
@#$ $#@ I know right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Atlus doesn't even do dual audio #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre arguing that p3s ending was happy because one man died for the good of others, and thats reasonable. #$%
@#$ $#@ However we don't know the actual human population sizes of either mikado or tokyo so your argument doesn't hold. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did that Octoling glitch get fixed? #$%
@#$ $#@ But the requirement for the reveal is a number of tweets that is greater than the number of Vita owners? #$%
@#$ $#@ What does Chaos says that isnt said on neutral? #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not as popular persona #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the game got a name now #$%
@#$ $#@ because that's what its called you slow shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Sharp FE is its Jap name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Jap don't call it SMT x - it's ATLUS x FE #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it isnt SMTxFE. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you in an SMT thread #$%
@#$ $#@ it got renamed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Genei Ibunroku #FE is its new name. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was changed to that when they revealed the first gameplay trailer. #$%
@#$ $#@ why not #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not a persona thread, there's no reason to bring up P3 #$%
@#$ $#@ what does #FE stand for now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fire Emblem Sharp #$%
@#$ $#@ Who Hikaru is and some other things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Here's your You #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll be left alone as long as they live like farmers forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Law ending doesnt specify at all what will happen once people go beyond that, if they would be left alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like to hang out with them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss Cozy and Tadashi #$%
@#$ $#@ Mate he loved everybody in the SEES, and in almost every case was romantically involved with at least one girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you that autistic that youre incapable of basic sympathy? #$%
@#$ $#@ the 3ds it's a good handheld #$%
@#$ $#@ sleep tight lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you get that revelation in neutral too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Given you have to face Lucy as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly it probably was because they keep almost going bankrupt until they eventually found out about how to milk money off weebs, and even that isnt really a sure thing since Index probably siphoned most of it to pay their own bills. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they have better luck with Sega, but I also hope they pull their heads out of their asses and improve the game design. #$%
@#$ $#@ If youre gonna nickle and dime me with DLC, at least make better base products. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you quote my post? #$%
@#$ $#@ It has absolutely nothing to do with platforms. #$%
@#$ $#@ stay mad believing persona is better than SMT #$%
@#$ $#@ Its par for the course. #$%
@#$ $#@ The shitflinging is inevitable. #$%
@#$ $#@ why did I open every single one of those #$%
@#$ $#@ to be fair, SMTIV was disappointing #$%
@#$ $#@ because Atlus never re-released a game before, and would totally announce a new SMT game while development was still ongoing for multiple other titles. #$%
@#$ $#@ So am I not retarded for dumping all points into str in 3? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you talking to yourself right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Should I come back later? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mah nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Its probably the best thing you can do, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would say, the game is piss easy after the very beginning and fucking pain in the ass to navigate because the game assumes you know the layout of Tokyo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Main problem for me was the inconcistent artstyle, many characters with portraits that dont ammount to anything and the shitty "dungeons". #$%
@#$ $#@ This is my only real problem, along with smirk when it goes against me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of the demon portraits just look like lightly penciled childrens drawings. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well gee, that sure narrows it down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks a lot genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why should i be mad when i can play both? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's 6pm over in nipland #$%
@#$ $#@ Kaga gets a portrait despite being in 2 conversations at most, and one of them involves her getting eaten. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its based on tweets and needs 15000 to show it, so if you want to know what it is; post the URL on your twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ And no one used half of those 400 seriously or as anything but fusion fodder. #$%
@#$ $#@ When Fujishits are the only market left for SMT #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you say that? #$%
@#$ $#@ falling for bait #$%
@#$ $#@ Her face and body color dont match. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even know they made that game for GBA. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty badass and works surprisingly well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play it on my GBA player as its great, even has voice acting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kirby vs Majin Buu was wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cloud vs Link was wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best play order is Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Peace Walker then Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. #$%
@#$ $#@ 1,2,3,4,5 nigga are you stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ nigga i dont know if that is funny or not.. #$%
@#$ $#@ depends on how much of a completionist you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ mg1/2 aren't very accessible and in all honesty, they're kind of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ the stealth gameplay mechanics are enormously enhanced with ps1 technology. #$%
@#$ $#@ however, mg1/2 are still metal gear games and will give you a metal gear experience. #$%
@#$ $#@ just not a great one #$%
@#$ $#@ what about that there mgs legacy collection? #$%
@#$ $#@ should i just get that and play in order #$%
@#$ $#@ Take the release order, just skip metal gear and metal gear 2, read the wiki and start with metal gear solid on ps1 #$%
@#$ $#@ Timeline order will make the most sense to you #$%
@#$ $#@ i legit dont know if this canon or not #$%
@#$ $#@ this post is embarrassing to read #$%
@#$ $#@ is there a particular reason to skip mg1 and mg2 or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre just old, but still good games. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you get the legacy collection you can give them a try and see if you like them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some plot points from them are key in MGS1. #$%
@#$ $#@ in the interest of full disclosure i am very drunk right now... #$%
@#$ $#@ and im pretty sure i ordered the legacy collection like an hour ago on amazon....is this series worth the time required to get through it?&gt; #$%
@#$ $#@ so is this not happening or what.... #$%
@#$ $#@ my god thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ Reverse alphabetical order unless the sum of previous numbered entire is more than the number of the next game, then you play it first #$%
@#$ $#@ haha, I know that feel bro #$%
@#$ $#@ Because of your spoiler tag, well have 50 more shitpost thread tomorrow of people bitching about unfair mechanics, you god damn monster. #$%
@#$ $#@ That boss is pretty easy though, the later ones are harder. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had to grind for the magma one because I was underleveled and couldnt do any damage #$%
@#$ $#@ Start by emulating seven, if your rig can manage it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more of a proper rpg and is slightly easier if you get flash gaurd down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that thats likely on a first playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ So does Nightmare mode add any mechanics or does it just make the bosses damage sponges and/or you a glass canon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that basically what Hatred was? #$%
@#$ $#@ what do you mean sequel? #$%
@#$ $#@ as in a brand new scavenger hunt? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was just shoot and kill in a setting that makes it hard to see #$%
@#$ $#@ what game. #$%
@#$ $#@ show porn #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds kinda like this game dungeonland except alot less casual and failed #$%
@#$ $#@ Could be fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played Dungeonland, but this idea isnt just against the one person shaping the whole map. #$%
@#$ $#@ I said L4D because to my mind its basically like if the Special Infected got a chance to quickly design their own small part of the map before the players get there. #$%
@#$ $#@ The glory of Sparta! #$%
@#$ $#@ Played like an angry fiddle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Boring character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enzi disk it'll poop #$%
@#$ $#@ THOU FURIOUS! #$%
@#$ $#@ It worked in first game and maybe second, but I swear in third game hes such a dick it almost makes me dislike the game itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Particularly terrible is how he kills Poseidon's wife, he fucking uses her as a stopper for a wheel, motherfucker couldn't be asses to look around for a boulder, which probably would be way easier that escorting her through a maze with weight puzzles and portals, he literally goes to unnecessary extents to brutally murder a person who he never met and who had zero influence on his whole life. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could expect this attitude from Postal dude, not a hero of greek tragedy. #$%
@#$ $#@ This was my problem in three. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gameplay was great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Story was fucking garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also there was darkness still in the box which drove Zeus crazy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well Captain was an asshole who tried to save his hide by condemning other people, Kratos only needed the key because there were people trapped behind that door and he was trying to save them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure had a zombie in it, not a live prisoner. #$%
@#$ $#@ Translators I agree, I disliked him for killing them as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a classic Greek hero. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those guys were all kind of assholes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone in the greek mythos was a total cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Super powered manbaby tantrum. #$%

@#$ $#@ Did everything wrong #$%
@#$ $#@ I never played GoW, how is it compared to NG:B and DMC? #$%
@#$ $#@ Less complex, more button-mashy, requires you to maneuver around the environment more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its much more style over substance, combat system is pretty much from a Dynasty warriors but with less enemies and plenty of QTE, but it is pretty cool to impale a massive hydra on a broken mast of a shit through its eye. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus theres plenty of decently designed puzzles. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game is good but only makes me want to play minecraft #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny given the post exactly above yours. #$%
@#$ $#@ The intro also really didnt have anything to do with the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesn't matter, if it's not FFVII, then a JRPG means nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not FFVII, doesn't matter, pleb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh goddamn that really was the GOAT intro. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can agree with this #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the best part. #$%
@#$ $#@ R.I.P Luka #$%
@#$ $#@ is this game any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like playing it from the intro #$%
@#$ $#@ that scene gave a huge boner when i was a kid #$%
@#$ $#@ dun dun dun dun dun dun dun #$%
@#$ $#@ Well said, son. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well said. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a filthy animal #$%
@#$ $#@ Its that kind of thread now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fish master race #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone guzzles jewcock #$%
@#$ $#@ You guys dont eat fish will all have an heart attack at the age of 39. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why even eat steak if its made that disgusting? #$%
@#$ $#@ When cook meat if you want to eat it raw? #$%
@#$ $#@ I for one would like my meat to be free of salmonella #$%
@#$ $#@ Those people are cute! #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the point in talking when deep down you have nothing worth sharing #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound very nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ faggot heh heh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im one of these poor souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its mainly because I sound like Im about 15 through a mic, even though Im almost 28. #$%
@#$ $#@ I envy people with bug manly voices ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive never seen someone with green skin. #$%
@#$ $#@ easy, i don't #$%
@#$ $#@ Not OP, but I act like I have some goddamn social skills and smile, even if you dont want to talk to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 10 am you stupid American cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ you might be me #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called social anxiety, OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Killed Maggies parents, and fucks her cunny every night. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a pedo. #$%
@#$ $#@ go to bed juan, and send pics of your mothers ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Argie pls go. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually like that, if done in moderation, gives the game personality. #$%
@#$ $#@ ...Does that face mean good or bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ That one song from FF13. #$%
@#$ $#@ They didnt even remix it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like that one guy who one listens to The End by Linkin Park #$%

@#$ $#@ Drakengard 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not entirely but rather often. #$%
@#$ $#@ Super Mario World #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Bully do that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant remember. #$%
@#$ $#@ Metal Gear Solid 1-3 #$%
@#$ $#@ But those games actually only have about 6 melodies anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smash Bros. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brawl and 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ luigis mansion #$%
@#$ $#@ Kingdom Hearts series does it a lot, with multiple character themes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy Type-0 #$%
@#$ $#@ Paper Mario Sticker Star is one example #$%
@#$ $#@ This is actually kind of creepy #$%
@#$ $#@ Kingdom Hearts is pretty notorious for this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Kingdom Hearts but I don't ever recall this happening besides hearing Sora's theme when you fight Vanitas #$%
@#$ $#@ Twilight Princess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Say what you want about the game, but the OST is great. #$%
@#$ $#@ go to bed robert #$%
@#$ $#@ YoshI Island 64 #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like poetry, it rhymes #$%
@#$ $#@ It starts out so nice, but eventually the theme becomes so foreboding that you start wondering if now would seriously be a good time to start thinking about bailing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Witches 3 did it a fair bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ dude wtf is going on #$%
@#$ $#@ You got me, you motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, just minerals. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally why Im buying FFXV. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit I don't know who thought this up but it's a fucking masterpiece #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy X #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, the Halo themes back? #$%
@#$ $#@ That bunny has some chubby thighs #$%
@#$ $#@ what is her overload? #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent unlocked it yet same for Killia. #$%
@#$ $#@ pyon master race reporting in #$%
@#$ $#@ they can just tone down the number of enemies for the vita port like how Nintendo got hyrule warriors on the 3ds #$%
@#$ $#@ Its already patched, and even then people discovered you can avoid the crashes by loading your save file, then from in-game load your save file again. #$%
@#$ $#@ could this be the solution? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not there yet, but professor seem like only a clinical trial bot to me, which it can do just fine while staying low level for giant status, nice on armor knights since they get like 2x hp, more defense, and cover while defending still works despite losing weapon skills letting them tank stuff 3-10x their level -- also nice for the AoE early on too when few skills #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 is not that bad #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes she does #$%
@#$ $#@ mechanically is a good jumo forward from 2, the story is average at best and terrible at worst, Mao is easily the worst protagonist and other than Beryl none of the others are even close to decent #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek more clothes #$%
@#$ $#@ She got demoted to being a generic unit, will she ever be relevant again? #$%
@#$ $#@ so do i , until post game where you can easily capture lvl 600+ cheat shop lvl 20 gunner in two turn and interrogate them all then extract all for magic extract with all stat +4000. #$%
@#$ $#@ combine in with maid evility so you can use it for 5 instead 1 #$%
@#$ $#@ pls stop it reminds me of my ex-gf and it makes me realize I'll never suck on her feminine penis ever again #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck are you fucks talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ just pretend they're not there #$%
@#$ $#@ How fucking new to Disgaea are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ this seems familiar #$%
@#$ $#@ More like BOOBtina, am I right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres that, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's almost as bad as Soul Hackers' bad mixing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you saying you dont like women with the bodies of men? #$%
@#$ $#@ The DLC costume covers her feet, which are normally nice and naked. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would never use that shit anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ That costume probably meant that she exposed her tits to the entire team multiple times each battle. #$%
@#$ $#@ 1 didnt have an OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's the best versions with most content #$%
@#$ $#@ With the exception of Disgaea DS, they are the definitive versions of each game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best versions #$%
@#$ $#@ Threadly reminder that the anime did nothing wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ should I watch the anime? #$%
@#$ $#@ no, you shouldn't watch anime #$%
@#$ $#@ If you D1 cast #$%
@#$ $#@ As you go up in the games the story gets worse and the gameplay gets better. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4 was really fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ God I want to lick Rozalins armpits and feet so bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its truly unfair that the best girl in the franchise is overshadowed by ironing boards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt this apply with practically every NIS release? #$%
@#$ $#@ The only shoehorned experience was La Pucelles re-release for the extra made followed the bad ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the other re-releases have sequel or prequel campaigns. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is supposed to be English, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you have those characters in the NEET squad? #$%
@#$ $#@ The NEET squad lowers stats. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do professors get any better? #$%
@#$ $#@ girl mage best girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Archers and Shaman are the only fappable generics #$%
@#$ $#@ You are an embarrassment. #$%
@#$ $#@ sure thing buddy #$%
@#$ $#@ This right here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Archers are a close second. #$%
@#$ $#@ quick question why is there a pregnant healer voice? #$%
@#$ $#@ She was called Marriage Obsessed Personality in DD2. #$%
@#$ $#@ No idea why they changed it to pregnant this time. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do they even do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im playing D4 and I named mine Milk E. #$%
@#$ $#@ My headcanon is that their breasts are filled with heal milk, and that's why they're so big and bouncy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prinny 2 had an Asagi mode so close enough #$%
@#$ $#@ Lots of status altering effects. #$%
@#$ $#@ They can raise move, throw, crit rate, HIT rate and a lot of debuffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre good with guns/staffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, theyre cute and have sexy legs and feet. #$%
@#$ $#@ you dont believe me negro? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like your headcanon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good taste #$%
@#$ $#@ That's hilarious #$%
@#$ $#@ screenshot pls, that sounds funny as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Original line #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Nisa. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should I sign on their forums and report this? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're the one it's happening to, that would probably be a good idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully they fix it before it melts your PS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was me who it happened to. #$%
@#$ $#@ I should see exactly how I caused this to happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ It should be pretty easy for a healer to be a slut, though... #$%
@#$ $#@ You shut your whore mouth, the cleric is pure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then how is N1 making Witch and the Hundred Knight 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ If they have financial issues, they wouldnt make that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ All they have to do is make Soul Nomad hd and I would give them my money #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they aint loaning from the Yakuza. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm talking about the cleric anon, not your waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ The cleric heals people, has big bouncy breasts and shows off her smelly bare feet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything about her is designed to attract men. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks for becoming obsolete #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for replacing the only well designed class #$%
@#$ $#@ I know it's a trap but why doesn't the dick understand that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Healer is the best girl #$%
@#$ $#@ you can skip floors but skipping a floor means you don't get the level towards enhancing the weapon from that floor #$%
@#$ $#@ is there a list of stage clears? #$%
@#$ $#@ id like to use them as a background. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im generally getting the impression its slower but not unbearably so, thats alright I suppose. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to have the monster available to be created to catch the monster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't catch ones you don't have access to. #$%
@#$ $#@ And English Fenrich is Dio. #$%
@#$ $#@ It comes full circle. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is so fucking awesome but unfitting for what i always picture his voice too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get Bloodis after chapter 8 right please right!? #$%
@#$ $#@ I seriously cant wait much longer his design is edge lordy as fuck but it looks so awesome to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just don't want to make the entire map devoid of enemies in 2 turns by using only 2 characters #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything can become an unstoppable god in Disgaea. #$%
@#$ $#@ A tier list would be who can get there the fastest I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was in D3 as DLC, and mentioned it was 10th anniversary of Marl Kingdom or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ But yeah, Marl has been forgotten by this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy the season pass goyim #$%
@#$ $#@ oh right, guess I'll give her heavy stance later, will be more defense too #$%
@#$ $#@ But Desco IS DLC #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe he meant DES X given the picture #$%
@#$ $#@ not that I know if those sliders work with dlc chars, I haven't bought any #$%
@#$ $#@ She pretty much the same as Desco #$%
@#$ $#@ Desco &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DES X #$%
@#$ $#@ why do they own bonus gauge ?? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she's a cunt #$%
@#$ $#@ Their evility is to attack when someone else attacks, so they rack up huge bonus gauge combos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Add Zeroken clones for instant archer team. #$%
@#$ $#@ you know, i think with this iteration, NIS really wants the player to try out all the classes; look at the quests to unlock other classes. #$%
@#$ $#@ They certainly stripped out some of the tedium by making generics autopromote. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only slightly ponderous thing is getting a full element spread on a wizard or your uniques, but Metallia can make that a snap if you get the DLC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont worry about the grind, the game can be played like a straight up TBS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im currently 33 hours in D1 in the postgame and my Laharl is Level 1300+ while my other chars are around levels 1-100.So concentrate on leveling Laharl.You can lift more than one teammate.You can capture monsters by throwing them in the dimensional gate bu you have to be twice as strong as them .In stage 4-3 i believe is the first power leveling spot in the game ,its the one with invicibilitypanels and 1 normal panel .You throw one enemy into anthore to level them up and then you throw them to the normal panel and then beat them up .Dont bother bribing the assembly just fuck their shit up when you get strong enough . #$%
@#$ $#@ The great thing about D2 is that they made that completely impossible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no way you can beat Xenolith just by powering through everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Character dungeon might also work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or you could just use Metallia, who has all omega and tera attack spells. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly don't know when the generics learn them since it's trivial to use her to teach before they hit 100, plus you can share with Christopher and sages/healers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes ideal for the 99 grind map since her int is ridiculous, so she can get them all very early. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats the purpose of character world??? #$%
@#$ $#@ It lets you improve your characters in various ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try it out if you havent already. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only takes a few minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even nearly impossible #$%
@#$ $#@ If you beat every halo on the MCC on legendary you unlock the Helioskrill armor for Halo 5. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the only Spartan suit made by the covenant. #$%
@#$ $#@ the helmet kinda looks like the hayabusa helmet from 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Im about halfway through 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Replaying the series by myself on legendary is actually pretty fun, since Im using some speedrun strats to get those par time achievements. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can see the resemblance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly I love the armor but Im in it moreso as a trophy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anybody can do halo 1, 3, and 4 on legendary. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo 2 was the fucking devil incarnate, and Im just glad I have something to show for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a time limit for it? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't tell me you didn't have trouble with Halo 2, the retarded artificial difficulty is absurd on a few levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ The beginning of gravemind, the jackals snipers on metropolis.. #$%
@#$ $#@ there's a few areas that made me want to tear my fucking hair out #$%
@#$ $#@ As far as I know you have until halo 5 releases, but I could be wrong, you may be able to get it at any point. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 doesnt really have a concrete answer. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait they lock you out if you dont beat them by the 27th? #$%
@#$ $#@ I get my Bone on the 23rd. #$%
@#$ $#@ If youre here on the 25th or so, I need a spawn buddy. #$%
@#$ $#@ To my knowledge the armor is available to anyone who beats 1-4 on legendary prior to Halo 5's release, but like I said I'm not 100% sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ It may still be available after release. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id look into it more. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't find much info about it from 343 #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt made by the covenent. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was made by a sangheili #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah thats pretty much what I did. #$%
@#$ $#@ I suppose its all just trial and error. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not so much difficult, just timing and knowing where enemies come from. #$%
@#$ $#@ C'Mon man I love Halo lore, but you're splitting hairs. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what I meant. #$%
@#$ $#@ The color and shine makes all the halo armors look like toys. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were Nazis Walter? #$%
@#$ $#@ You completely misunderstood the graph. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I use the scarab gun skull and still have it count? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait until you get to gravemind #$%
@#$ $#@ Do it with a friend, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least its not like 2 where if one of you dies you have to revert. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might try for it if it didn't look like shit #$%
@#$ $#@ First time I got to the end of the level on Legendary my game froze. #$%
@#$ $#@ Took 4 hours. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to smash my Xbox. #$%
@#$ $#@ The beginning is the most broken, aggravating experience I have ever endured. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant say I love the helmet but the rest is awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a huge delay/lag whenever I try it with a buddy. #$%
@#$ $#@ So co-op is out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre brutes, not elites. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have no shield so the plasma pistol is useless #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh I thought you were talking about Cairo Station #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah I was talking about Gravemind. #$%
@#$ $#@ That part of Cairo was a pain in the ass as well though #$%
@#$ $#@ Not mine, just felt like sharing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also youre unironically using the word uber and you expect to be taken seriously? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can go back to reddit now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad 343's Mark V looks like warm runny shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Or you know, CoD pretty much filled the "dudebro FPS" niche and the newer Halos have no redeeming qualities, thus scaring away previous Halo fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, Only had anything happen when the restarted the server. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've already endured 1 and 2 on Legendary on the original xbox, I'm not doing that shit again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry anon, I don't visit reddit, I don't know what words all the cool kids are using. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have a source for that? #$%
@#$ $#@ why would the covenant make a spartan suit #$%
@#$ $#@ They deserve most of the blame, but youre making a huge assumption when you say that they get 100%. #$%
@#$ $#@ People acknowledge the other teams as being failures already, so everyone already thinks of them as jokes, but none of them stood up and charged $60 for their failure. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 did. #$%
@#$ $#@ On top of that, those teams arent responsible for updating the game to fix the bugs. #$%
@#$ $#@ 343 is responsible, and they choose not to fix it. #$%
@#$ $#@ We already know all the custom game and forge options though and they blow everything we've had before out of the water #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, its also shocking that the Premium bundle is onetime buy only. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck would any Halo fan buy Halo 5 nigga? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a fucking retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The statistic for the 5 beta included when it went open beta, thus massively diluting the hours played per person #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is the elbow armor piece floating? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that covenant technology or just a mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have to beat ODST or is it just the main series #$%
@#$ $#@ Just main series #$%
@#$ $#@ It should stay in for Breakout at least, because DEAR GOD its missing there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you considered its because they dont like spartans acting like dudebros, aka the entire reason they hate S4s? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought Reach sold a hell of a lot better than that #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry Im not a filthy casual. #$%
@#$ $#@ I completed the campaigns on legendary even before the heioskrill announcement #$%
@#$ $#@ Until spivs get retconned into not being dudebros, its stupid to claim theyre not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because thats exactly what they are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marines are the most dudebro dudebros around. #$%
@#$ $#@ It did, thats by the time 4 came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a 4v4 mode, both teams jump into the map via man cannons and have one life. #$%
@#$ $#@ First to 5 rounds win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like Speedball with firearms. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4v4 elimination game mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo 5s take on CS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically, each side has much less health/shields and 1 life. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played it during the beta, it was fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, otherwise it'd be stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Right thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ What other gametypes are there? #$%
@#$ $#@ Standard death match and shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ the only other new game more they've shown off is warzone, which is 12v12 on very, very large maps not forge world sized by like half of that with AI as well, you kill AI bosses and capture bases and shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Basic halo modes, a new-ish thing called Strongholds, kinda like Dominion from H4 or Domination from CoD and others. #$%
@#$ $#@ There wasnt anything new I tried other than Warzone. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thats 12v12 with PvE elements. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ready Up Live seems to have the best quality captures and hes not bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ His commentary may grate on some people but you can just mute if so. #$%
@#$ $#@ The same gametypes every other halo game has. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oddball, king of the hill, territories and assault now with different names, I forget them, infection or flood, grifball, etc #$%
@#$ $#@ Is MCC co-op still unplayable when it comes to lag? #$%
@#$ $#@ With 1-2 second delay for everyone off-hosting? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you notice that you can actually see the enemy team jump off too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just noticed that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never had problem with co-op. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe your internet is shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow I have some stellar reading comprehension. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, my internet is good, and it doesnt lag on any other game or even in the versus mode, only in co-op on MCC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck, I didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I read you can turn it off in the options #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully the false callouts were just a beta bug. #$%
@#$ $#@ Skinny ass arms #$%
@#$ $#@ Already had it beat since launch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also that suit looks pretty tarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ What armor do you get for having every achievement in Halo MCC? #$%
@#$ $#@ Albeit that faggot made a blog post are you really justifying the shit that is soon to be halo 5? #$%
@#$ $#@ you more than likely haven't played it and are just jumping on the hate bandwagon so your opinion is moot #$%
@#$ $#@ Jumping isn't important anymore since you can just jetpack to places and shit like that, and that's a huge loss for the franchise imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just linked to the achievement, I doubt there's a time limit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will say you completed it on legendary, yeah, but you wont get the achievements for it #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I am not gonna change it until they implement a one-time free name change #$%
@#$ $#@ I unlocked the legendary achievements and helioskrill while using the scarab skull on Halo 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if it was patched like the halo 4 spartan ops glitch but whatever #$%
@#$ $#@ sam died for this #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it #$%
@#$ $#@ Where did he say that he was surprised? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just that Sam died for the opportunity to be replaced by a bunch of faggots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ that looks like generic ass shitty sci-fi armour. #$%
@#$ $#@ You still might in the campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should have just made it an option like the chatter. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked them. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is actually depressing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Much better. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of that DUDE HIGH FIVE LMAO bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you know off the top of your head how badly the military looks down upon anti depressants? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know right. #$%
@#$ $#@ God forbid some of the unsc's greatest soilders act with some fucking discipline #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but one of my friends in the Marines got a dishonorable discharge when they found out he was taking them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, thats sad to hear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id love to serve. #$%
@#$ $#@ every Spartan IV in the campaign is fine though #$%
@#$ $#@ "when they found out he was taking them" means he was taking them illegally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im in the military and they prescribed me antidepressants no problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ My bad, I just remembered it was just "I heard you would be taller".. #$%
@#$ $#@ she didnt even address him. #$%
@#$ $#@ If that was any other character in the series you wouldnt give a shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want a good mix between the two. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dudebros are annoying and soldiers are too generic and overplayed. #$%
@#$ $#@ How else are they going to build their own armor unless they can replicate it first? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant reverse engineer something without making a replica first. #$%
@#$ $#@ No youre the faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bunch of people in a warzone arent going to start jacking each other off #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, I didnt know people thought the idea of a soldier involved breakdancing and highfives. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the way she said it, made her come off as a cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ But shes still a cunt so people hate her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously, if Sgt Johnson said that, the way he would have said it would have been more light hearted. #$%
@#$ $#@ What other character would it even be. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most have them have known Chief already or were saved by him or served with him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every other character also has a sense of respect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit you're an idiot, that's exactly what marines do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called gallows humor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Referring to the silent standing as what a soldier should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean the no-named ones that have literally 0 lines and we see for 10 minutes? #$%
@#$ $#@ We know nothing about them or their personality. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are all nameless nobodies. #$%
@#$ $#@ But you said the latter were faggots, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Surely you mean the ones who want a frat party think thats what a soldier is. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4 was one of the easier campaigns to finish on Legendary as I recall. #$%
@#$ $#@ I found 2 and Reach to be much harder and CE hit a sweet spot in difficulty #$%
@#$ $#@ Can confirm too many deaths in h2 with new graphics can crash the game to the dash, and split screen doesnt let you keep checkpoints. #$%
@#$ $#@ So depending on the run you can lose all that level progress. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which other character would even dare to say something like that to Chief besides Johnson obviously? #$%
@#$ $#@ His deeds merit respect not some shitty response about his height when he still stands at least half a head taller than Palmer. #$%
@#$ $#@ so can we finally kill that bitch in Halo 5 when Chief goes Nuclear on ONIs ass? #$%
@#$ $#@ Random marines in all the campaigns say silly shit to Chief all the time #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I the only one who thought it was meant to be taken as a light-hearted jest? #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean Palmer was giving him a pretty interesting once-over before smirking and saying that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grabbing a bone for both. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love my bullshit couch shooters #$%
@#$ $#@ does it have the numbers for halo 2 and 3? #$%
@#$ $#@ A little advice, if you go into law enforcement/military, dont hide things like that from your superiors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be upfront, and like 2/3 of the time they will accommodate you or help you cover it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those child-bearing hips... #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the tip man #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to make a very naive statement by assuming that MLG people couldnt care less about the winning pose and if they do, they dont deserve this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ MLG fags dont care about anything other than their very specific list of demands. #$%
@#$ $#@ as long as they remake the the armor and not have it be the 4/Reach/CEA version #$%
@#$ $#@ are you for real right now #$%
@#$ $#@ You've never played a Halo game before #$%
@#$ $#@ Why'd they have to make it look plastic #$%
@#$ $#@ I really dont have a good answer for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people say its because its a War Games simulation but that isnt really satisfactory. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the artists just have shitty taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ can somebody tell me if this guy is a retard or not, i don't know how beta's work #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is going to lower the average hours played, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ i was gonna buy an xbone for this, but not after seeing those stats.. #$%
@#$ $#@ Over 1000 req cards at launch and more after #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a fucking jpeg ffs.... #$%
@#$ $#@ i looked up the numbers to verify, it's legit #$%
@#$ $#@ It was made by a FEMALE sangheili. #$%
@#$ $#@ doesnt he mean that it will be in req cards for those casull retards that cant beat the games on Legendary? #$%
@#$ $#@ spartan armor was bases of saghelli armor you dingus. #$%
@#$ $#@ halo lore 101 go back to and study at halo wiki #$%
@#$ $#@ yep that's exactly what it means : #$%
@#$ $#@ the play time per player is what concerns me, it appears that 5 doesn't have the replay value that 3 had #$%
@#$ $#@ They hadnt made the Spartan armor yet, you fucking autist. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck does that even have to do with what I just said? #$%
@#$ $#@ No it wasnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt based off of Elite armor in the slightest. #$%
@#$ $#@ The armor itself is completely human in nature. #$%
@#$ $#@ The shield generator was reverse-engineered from a Jackal shield. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sangheili had NOTHING to do with the development of Spartans or MJOLNIR. #$%
@#$ $#@ its been confirmed you can get the armor by other means #$%
@#$ $#@ The only people who care you have that armor are the only people who would care enough to check your achievements. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is exactly what is implemented at this time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go change it you NERD. #$%
@#$ $#@ MCC exists anon #$%
@#$ $#@ MCC is fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ 90% of the player base are fucking scrubs that you can wipe the floor with all day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially in CE where somehow kids still haven't figured out they need to use the magnum #$%
@#$ $#@ probably never #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo Online #$%
@#$ $#@ Im Elusive Serpent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Add me. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fucking point then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanksgiving is tomorrow dumbass hahahaha #$%
@#$ $#@ So what's going to be the Halo game to fill in 2017 before 6 and hopefully the new xbox so we can leave the xbone behind forever #$%
@#$ $#@ El Dewrito and official Halo Online #$%
@#$ $#@ Please be fake, because that is bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd argue that's a problem, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ The levels are big, but mostly empty. #$%
@#$ $#@ The hardware wasnt goo enough to fill the space. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember I did something simular for gears of war 3 launch, went back and beat gears 1 on hardest difficulty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got the golden sawed off shotgun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad I dont have a xbone : #$%
@#$ $#@ There is literally nothing wrong with Sierra 117 #$%
@#$ $#@ God why does this game look so fucking disgusting #$%
@#$ $#@ Been meaning to get it, got a job, got the money, and I want the statue. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I find a decent camera, I might do an unboxing thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Itd be my first ever though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve skipped both of the best levels in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, John. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dinos GTFO #$%
@#$ $#@ Person who asked, seconding this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was gonna post an image and explain why but I hit submit post by mistake #$%
@#$ $#@ HUMAN RACE #$%
@#$ $#@ that's just her armor plate #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuckers shouldnt have been controlling the country through the banking system and plotting to fund and execute a revolution. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jackals are pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently they were space pirates before the covenant got them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theory is that the jackals get some kind of compensation in return for the cooperation with the covenant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reach just had a more dedicated core of players than Halo 4 did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both games were unpopular with the wider community. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol this post #$%
@#$ $#@ They havent learned shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They still over design everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Angles and layers for no reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is he wearing turian armor? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm 29 and I'm hyped as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not illegal to be retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just should know that your opinion doesnt matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well shit, I never played halo and bought the bundle, and I didnt even know, have been playing it from time to time and now I must drop out of college and sell my child to do this. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing mediocre about this game is the decision rockstar made in its EULA regarding mods. #$%
@#$ $#@ That and a triple A game launched on the PC and you could use cheat engine to effect server side data. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not this screenshot though right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because thats a XB1/PS4/PC screenshot. #$%
@#$ $#@ congratulations, you're a retard who acts like a meth addict and you're somehow proud of it #$%
@#$ $#@ If yr assuming because first person you go pov for cab, train rides #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the minimap is bordered on the 360/PS3 version #$%
@#$ $#@ Insides of cars arent really detailed on 360, and that sign the guys holding would be pixilated because it wouldnt become detailed if you entered first person driving. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound like you should be in reddit, sucking sanders cock, so you could be paid in sucking the cocks that cuck Bernie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are russians such vile creatures online? #$%
@#$ $#@ From Fallout Online to haven and hearth to literally any online game, they're a destructive force of evil, ruining anything in their path like locusts #$%
@#$ $#@ Also his favorite form of media is impotent rage, which is about an ultra liberal superhero fighting the tyrany of the right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where have i said im proud? #$%
@#$ $#@ I said i identify with him, not that it made me a better man than you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not a taxi. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats FPS view in a Declasse Tornado on XB1/PS4/PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Impotent rage is a parody of liberals, not in defense of them #$%
@#$ $#@ graphics, AI, and Physics was the best out of all GTA games and it ran better than shitty ass poorly optimized GTA 4 on consoles and PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ People come on here and go on about "GTA V sucks cuz Trevor is a bad character" but who fucking cares about all that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the best in literally every other way. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had it on PS3 way before the ps4/xbone/PC versions came out and barely anyone was ever online so if i had to guess probably less people play now. #$%
@#$ $#@ That part where they tried to have fucking Trevor of all people be the evangelical pro-immigrant of those immigration side missions which were also terrible gameplay-wise was pretty fucking cringy. #$%
@#$ $#@ yep overhype as shit #$%
@#$ $#@ online is full of modders #$%
@#$ $#@ not that anon but your shit is retarded fam smh #$%
@#$ $#@ Chapter 1 was perfect, if there was a new location on chapter 2 I and mission 51 was not cut I wouldn' feel so disappointed #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say that MGSV easily has the best gameplay, but worst story out of the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can agree with this #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd say it is basically Peace Walker+ #$%
@#$ $#@ Y'know it's a little nitpick and I'd have to go back and actually confirm, but in peace walker with the consecutive cqc, isn't it more like... #$%
@#$ $#@ varied and detailed? #$%
@#$ $#@ In 5 you just throw dudes the same way every time but I could have sworn it was better in PW. #$%
@#$ $#@ Full disclosure I played the HD remake. #$%
@#$ $#@ You still get the multi cqc, but its a bit harder to trigger now. #$%
@#$ $#@ true, playing as him would be way more acceptable, and the mission came out of nowhere too #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure you had different directions of throws with the consecutive CQC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just remember, BB is better than Venom Snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess there's less incentive to do cross overs when you're doing a multiplat unless you pull a soul calibur and have a different cross over for each platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean what would MGSV have even crossed over with? #$%
@#$ $#@ Far Cry? #$%
@#$ $#@ Gameplay wise PW is a bit smoother version of PO, which is understandable, but story and level layout and boss fights are all superior in PO. #$%
@#$ $#@ agreed, although the cutscene of her doing crazy anime moves was worth it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I may be the only one, but I actually liked dragging abductees to your truck. #$%
@#$ $#@ It meant that you had to have a clear route out and that you would spend enough time on a level that tranqs and CQC might actually wear off and start to cause you trouble. #$%
@#$ $#@ If only there were a good middle ground between the two styles of abduction, fultons are just too easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only certain missions allow vehicles and they're automatically picked from your selection since there's no variance in them like there was in PW. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good point. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Huey being the one to call him out is great, because Huey is such a lying immoral sack of shit it both adds to his shittiness and reaffirms that Venom did the right thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ If soemone logical like Ocelot or, hell even Miller, called him out it would put a worse light on Venom. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Huey being the one adds more moral ambiguity and necessity in Venoms actions. #$%
@#$ $#@ they were all infected anon #$%
@#$ $#@ They're talking about combat deployments #$%
@#$ $#@ but it's Thanksgiving tomorrow here in Canada fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres just too much space for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Limiting staff space to like 50 for each category would have been better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you would actually have to make decisions about staff and not just FULTON HIM FULTON THEM FULTON EVERYTHING 10,000 TROOPS #$%
@#$ $#@ what, when? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh my bad #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly I sink a lot of hours into the game but the research times still bother me, especially when its something I need for a mission and I have to do some repetitive side ops to wait out the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think PW did this the best tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fultoning itself is a lot of fun, it feels good to do, but when you have 48 wormholes it just makes the game a cakewalk. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never liked the way PW handled research timers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rather just have a straight timer, I do think some of the later timers are unreasonable though. #$%
@#$ $#@ the 20-40 minutes stuff should have been the max, 2 and a half hours is just retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ The 24 hours for the nuke was fine though I think, makes it feel more impactful. #$%
@#$ $#@ He posted all of these today #$%
@#$ $#@ It was kind of funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ They couldve fixed that in TPP but took the whole thing out instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ They could've just made the exact same thing and put it in TPP and it would've a lot better than what we got instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that I S ranked the two sahelanthropus missions I just sell all tanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ this hurts me #$%
@#$ $#@ TIME is the hugest factor and gives you like 120K points while alerts and damage taken only take a few 100 or 1000 points. #$%
@#$ $#@ Given the game is unfinished as is, and it would take a lot of effort to make combat deployment enjoyable, you'd have to make it an entire little minigame and spend a bunch of time balancing and QA testing it, I'm glad they just cut it instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having nothing at all is better than what was in Peace Walker. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOUNG GIRL #$%
@#$ $#@ The truck...the back...is empty! #$%
@#$ $#@ Motherbase being a giant oil rig again was annoying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres nothing really to do there either and the guards say the same damn shit over and over. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was expecting to be able to customize its layout so I was sorely dissapointed. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont like driving 5 minutes to get to another platform? #$%
@#$ $#@ What about taking the helicopter while it makes 10 loops around the platform youre trying to land at? #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS4 is probably the worst possible place he could have ended the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ V may be unfinished but its a way better send off to the franchise than the mediocre schlock that is MGS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ I forgot about this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were both mediocre story and gameplay wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some great ideas but they're extremely flawed and don't gel as well as the old games. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS3 had its awful menus you bring up constantly, MGS2 had constant codec calls interrupting you almost as bad as cutscenes in MGS4, MGS1 had mediocre gameplay, MG2 had mediocre plot, MG1 has all kinds of obscure irritating shit as is typical of games of that era, fucking destructible walls. #$%
@#$ $#@ No game's perfect, V is no more flawed than any other entry in the series and they're all significantly less flawed than MGS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do I need to post any scene with Johnny and Meryl? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Big Bosss zero speech? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or any scene with Naomi? #$%
@#$ $#@ A couple good scenes dont completely make up for a game full of horrible schlock. #$%
@#$ $#@ He should have stopped with 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah a bit more humor would have been nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not as grim as they acted like it would be before release so its not like humor would have been entirely out of place. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, I liked the hamburgers but it felt wrong for it to be Kaz since hes so fucking grim in this game, basically any other character would have worked better there I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I guess it was all for the McDonnels gag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also limiting the amount of gear you have and having to pay and wait for more kind of fucks up the whole dicking around that's so much fun in past MGS #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright smart guy, how do I salute my soldiers? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, ok I get it now, youre the boss, generals dont go around saluting every bumfuck PFC, but at least when you get off the chopper and you have the four guys lined up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even fucking the President salutes the Marines that stand by Marine One. #$%
@#$ $#@ An Admiral will salute a lowly seamn recruit when hes being let on a ship/passes them by. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Raikov was saluting all sorts of fucks in MGS3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre annoying. #$%
@#$ $#@ especially when youre listening to them in the field and some radio chatter plays over them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Volgin was pointless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Almost as bad as bringing Sokolov back in PO. #$%
@#$ $#@ And now nanomachines are digital/electronic/mechanical versions of these parasites? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lol thanks Kojima. #$%
@#$ $#@ Huey was such a terrible character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Peacewalker introduced so much bile into the canon that Im mad I even played it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It isnt, really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reflex makes the game way too easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing without is fair because its focused around your own fuckups like not scouting the base properly or using a companion to scout the base in later levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Venom not having any emotional reaction to Volgin was the weirdest part, like fuuuck, just....just say "Volgin?" #$%
@#$ $#@ you tripple nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ I WANNA GET OFF THE RUSE CRUISE #$%
@#$ $#@ Well if even one of them had a shotgun they could stunlock you into oblivion. #$%
@#$ $#@ They shouldve just made him kind of evil from the get go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, 'yeah this guy is a dick, but he knows his nukes so we gotta trust him.' #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead, they tried to make double Otacon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Using the same voice actor was stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ They probably just don't do it because the AC aesthetic wouldn't work as well in Japan not to mention they generally had shorter buildings due to the constant earthquakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ AC hasnt had any positive qualities for a very long time anyway so its not like going to Japan would improve them at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS4 already had an AssCreed crossover. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wanted to climb a legitmate mountain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like there'd be some secret base in a mountain and we'd have to scale it and blend into the rocks to avoid helicopters and baby Metal Gears. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldve been cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just think rock climbing is cool and MGSV was the first time in a game where it felt satisfying since the old Tomb Raiders. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know the new TR has it with the pick axe but that whole game just felt...off to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best scene in the game was the burial at sea one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only time when the acting and directing felt legitmately good #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would he say that? #$%
@#$ $#@ He probably doesnt even know who he is. #$%
@#$ $#@ He had all of Big Boss memories implanted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but he wasnt Big Boss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having someone's memories doesn't mean you have lived those memories and traumas yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is why Volgin just turns off by himself in his last standoff and the Mammal Pod doesnt care about you after the first seconds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like DD or MSF were the first PMCs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the first of those was founded in 1965 by ex-SAS members, and a former Nazi founded the Paladin Group in 1970. #$%
@#$ $#@ so did i #$%
@#$ $#@ PO was how Fouxhound got started. #$%
@#$ $#@ They never really state how MSF got started or how BB ever met Miller #$%
@#$ $#@ But 4 came out after PO #$%
@#$ $#@ You lost me at X, but you got the rest right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot the image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you just go on the internet and lie like that anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ 750ti is heavily obsolete in terms of both raw power as well as price point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even that garbage 950 is more of a steal than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is the 950 garbage? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like you get better performance for cheaper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure if your choice is between a Furyx and 950 for free, its a shit choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Furyx is not free. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you enjoy playing at 20fps? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's just a suped up version of the 750ti except it uses the old price point and it hasn't been crippled to shit by nVidia yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ i think you fellow PCucks always exxagerate about hardware becoming outdated... #$%
@#$ $#@ i will ultra fallot 4 like i did with pcars too and mgs5 #$%
@#$ $#@ How did witcher 3 play on ultra for you buddy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or even wolfenstien for that matter #$%
@#$ $#@ mostly alright except for the low res #$%
@#$ $#@ Not with playable FPS you dont. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im so tired of the slideshow idiots bragging about this everything on max-shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has never been true. #$%
@#$ $#@ for me playable is 24+ fps #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on the game, the 970 is fine for pretty much anything released so far at 1080p. #$%
@#$ $#@ Titans are generally considered horrible in terms of price / performance. #$%
@#$ $#@ My friend owns a 980 and I own a 970 and the performance is pretty close, but the thing is is the fucked vram will become an issue for the 970 but obviously not for the 980 meaning itll more than likely last longer before needing to upgrade. #$%
@#$ $#@ As for the 980ti it seems to be a beast of a card but I never looked into it since its so far out of what i could afford. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to say this is pretty amazing. #$%
@#$ $#@ FXAA if correctly used its pretty good at some games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like in TPP or Killing Floor 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Underrated post #$%
@#$ $#@ True, but still i prefer no AA to anything blurry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hows the life on a moon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been kinda out of the loop for a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna give it a watch now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Asura, but until Saitama is given a limit we may never know. #$%
@#$ $#@ How fucking slow are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ best subs to get? #$%
@#$ $#@ most animes start only with 12 episodes #$%
@#$ $#@ To read Muratas glorious art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Black Lagoon started with 12 episodes and it flopped like hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you blame them? #$%
@#$ $#@ It'd be fucking impossible to keep the budget for 24 episodes if they're doing crazy shit like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt it 26 though, with a movie and spin off? #$%
@#$ $#@ Scarf Ditto #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to see them get a to do a movie that is mostly still frames and then 10 minutes of the best animation ever #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I dont think there is. #$%
@#$ $#@ The real question is, who would win between Saitama and GER Giorno? #$%
@#$ $#@ Scribblenauts is the very definition of a meme game. #$%
@#$ $#@ /vp/ pls go #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama may be strong, but can he beat Kings infinite combo? #$%
@#$ $#@ The one true God of the gaming world. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is a gameplay feature, like CRPGs with pause-combat feature. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you give the notebook to other NPCs, there will be no "time stop" effect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fafner Exodus looks 10 times better than this and its going to have 26 episodes. #$%
@#$ $#@ ironically this is how it feels to have a broken stat character in those games #$%
@#$ $#@ well it is easier when you draw everyone with the same face #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no way that A ranked Caped Baldy could ever beat King. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama is B ranked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a rank after the garou incident. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but Saitama can punch REALLY hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ someone doesnt read ONE's opm #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes A ranked now. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would only create a copy of Saitama that is dead, while the original Saitama is still there #$%
@#$ $#@ i think he's Demon Cyborg's assistant or something they hang out a lot #$%
@#$ $#@ Who can beat King at vidya? #$%
@#$ $#@ literally nobody #$%
@#$ $#@ Demon Cyborg is way too cool for that guy, he probably just stalks him and takes the left overs #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the ONE version of the manga, baka. #$%
@#$ $#@ Garous arc only just started in muratas version, and the filler fighting tournaments only going to delay the fantastic arc even more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its already done in the ONE version. #$%
@#$ $#@ He won't get a chance to do it though #$%
@#$ $#@ Technically, closing someone in a gap for eternity doesnt really count as a defeat. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's the updated manga, the original version is way ahead of it #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the original finished now? #$%
@#$ $#@ The loli is best girl, get out of /v/ you normie reeeeeeeeee and all that #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, last chapter he was fighting with the psychic S-rank loli. #$%
@#$ $#@ madara uchiha, but not just etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ et.c e.tc.e tec #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but hes also like, REALLY fast. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, the original is still ongoing, but murata's adding filler to make sure that his slow pace doesn't catch up with the really slow updates of the original webcomic. #$%
@#$ $#@ The original is a webcomic ONE is doing as a hobby. #$%
@#$ $#@ It may never be done. #$%
@#$ $#@ ONE needs no defense. #$%
@#$ $#@ His doodles have a charm that still adds a lot to the comic, which is why his silly face still lacks detail. #$%
@#$ $#@ And the serious table flip still looked good with doodles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just a man who loves lolis. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, veggies will be on sale tommorow. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kept waiting to see the part from the gif everyone posts, but turns out it's not in the volumes from madokami, and it's only on the online readers? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, /a/ is worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ For /v/ to be as bad as /a/, wed need to have constant threads about CoD and BF. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might be talking out of my ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently there's a LN about Giorno as the mob boss where he's using Gold Experience Requiem freely. #$%
@#$ $#@ he'd one shot either of them #$%
@#$ $#@ But we have constant threads about specific games like /a/ with anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ DmC always gets threads making fun of it, and TLOU still gets threads after two years. #$%
@#$ $#@ The COD and BF equivalent would be SAO, SNK, KLK, NGNL, or whatevers the big show of the season. #$%
@#$ $#@ dress &gt; half-naked #$%
@#$ $#@ The gif in questions #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you implying there were no SAO thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing that would make /a/ worse would be Naruto threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the first episode, I havent got around to watching episode 2 yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its alright, but powerlevel threads will ruin discussion of the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama is literally called "One-Punch Man" because he can end any fight with one punch. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he can hit them, they lose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lurk more. #$%
@#$ $#@ compared to this from the manga #$%
@#$ $#@ haha you should internet it #$%
@#$ $#@ Raiden is considerably fast, I actually dont know both peoples speed but do you think he can hit raiden? #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama is small time to be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama can destroy cities with a table flip. #$%
@#$ $#@ the entire joke of the comic is that he's the fastest and strongest thing in the universe #$%
@#$ $#@ Please respond, how there be such a huge difference in Chapter 17? #$%
@#$ $#@ He'd rape demonbane #$%
@#$ $#@ His life is suffering. #$%
@#$ $#@ He holds back on purpose, though, so it doesnt really count. #$%
@#$ $#@ Murata likes to redraw scenes to make them better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Compare this... #$%
@#$ $#@ With this. #$%
@#$ $#@ 12 is enough to get to Boros. #$%
@#$ $#@ Downplaying the rampant shitposting and meme fuckery in /v/ isnt going to make /a/ any worse brahs. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is fucking with my autism,now I'm gonna be worried about if I'm reading the definite version of Manga now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Directors Cut of Manga? #$%
@#$ $#@ Movies are annoying enough to research. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was just saying both are bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ /a/ is slightly better because shit always comes out every day, whereas vidya has constant gaps between game releases. #$%
@#$ $#@ The comic was originally a webcomic with silly doodlesmade by ONE. #$%
@#$ $#@ They werent great drawings, but they have charm and are still enjoyable. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series got popular enough for a good artistmurata to notice it and decide to make an official version with good art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both are decent reads, but ONEs version has more events to read about while murata adds filler to keep himself from catching up to the original webcomic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Powerman doesnt count. #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesnt make Wobuffet invincible. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has to tank a hit first to return it twofold. #$%
@#$ $#@ The anime lied to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ T.Hanks Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ here's another one #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, heres how it looks in the manga... #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck Murata? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga I don't think you understand just how bullshit Saitama actually IS #$%
@#$ $#@ Murata is a genius but he needs to ketchup namean? #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously it isnt funny if I just explained the entire joke do you out of context. #$%
@#$ $#@ You actually have to read/watch it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Genos best girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ DRR DRR DRR #$%
@#$ $#@ I tend to go HorribleSubs or BakedFish #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey man, what did moles ever do to you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre just mad a robot cat whose job is to take care of children could beat Saitama. #$%
@#$ $#@ They dig the fuck out of my yard and leave massive fucking molehills all over the damn place. #$%
@#$ $#@ well redline did take 7 years to make #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how they show their love. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more like a humorous slice of life manga, contrasting a mediocre-looking hero with extremely large and detailed monsters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want their love. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want them to fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, in any case people who aren't black hearted little shits don't hate moles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Demonbane had it's own kart racer, it's video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ eeeeh, so its just another kill la kill/michael bay movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't that take 7years to make #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how after that, the clouds are split behind him #$%
@#$ $#@ 7 YEARS HAND DRAWN #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad he was retconned into a saiyan #$%
@#$ $#@ no it's really nothing like either of those #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna say probably not, but it's hard to judge Sonic on anything because he loses to Saitama every time, so he doesn't have very many solid feats #$%
@#$ $#@ Plot doesnt really revolve around Saitama that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ His cyber fuccboi gets more balanced fights seeing how he isnt overpowered. #$%
@#$ $#@ would die in one punch #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously guys, the plot is that OPM is invincible, and can wins fights with one punch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless there is a video game character with the same plot then there is no chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever, he could still win. #$%
@#$ $#@ why don't you stop being such a cucking fock and realize you can enjoy something without it being 2deep4u serious bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ There are several video games starring The Flash, so, The Flash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mr Satan is an actual martial artist, and the best in the world minus the Z fighters #$%
@#$ $#@ He killed God and got wiped from existence and reincarnated in Street Fighter, so no but if he dies he just comes back anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ You make it sound like King isn't a great hero in his own right #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the worst meme of 2015. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not funny, its not clever, it doesnt even make fucking sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ One joke man? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a joke? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well yeah thats kind of the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saitama punched his way through a planet buster attack #$%
@#$ $#@ literally /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ But does he have the power of slams and jams? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Barkley wins. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes not wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's unbeatable, he's completely invincible and kills everything on contact with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's arguably the strongest character in all of fiction, his character is just powerman, but drawn better #$%
@#$ $#@ Parents buy shit for little children too, I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ cthuko or commie. #$%
@#$ $#@ We might have something here considering Cains curse involves whatever happens to him being inflicted back on whoever did it to him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I forget if it has a higher intensity or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally invincible. #$%
@#$ $#@ He'll die, but he'll just keep coming back only angrier. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything, he might win out of apathy/pity in Saitama. #$%
@#$ $#@ saitama would serious punch all of them once #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but Saitama punches REALLY hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHERE WERE YOU WHEN MADHOUSE SAVED ANIME?!?!? #$%
@#$ $#@ GER could actually beat Saitama, since only stand users can see or harm stands. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shiki can kill Power-Man, discuss #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, any high level existence can completely bypass/negate/remove GERs rule/power. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't remember this on Murata's version, is he cutting content or is this further on? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or its fan made? #$%
@#$ $#@ i don't think you understand how hard saitama punches things #$%
@#$ $#@ Everybody could beat GER in the real world since GER couldn't DO CRAP against real-life beings, #$%
@#$ $#@ that picture is just proof that the writing for the flash is below the shittiest shit tier #$%
@#$ $#@ Show me some proof that he's not #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is the point? #$%
@#$ $#@ Let me play as Genos, hes the relatable self insert. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thats why you never take DC shit seriously. #$%
@#$ $#@ he couldnt kill a mosquito #$%
@#$ $#@ I literally just gave you the speed of The Flash, now show me the speed of Saitama. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bugs Bunny could beat flash, joke character always beat serious characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem with comics is that there is no consistency since theyre written by multiple authors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Precisely, it gives a sense of mass to the characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except GERs power is based on human conception limitation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Higher level beings can easily see GER's power as child's play, and something laughabily primitive and so limited in scope to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, next question. #$%
@#$ $#@ From what I hear, Flash's overpoweredness was meant to be balanced out by the fact that he's supposedly a fucking idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ So the moral is: Dont MinMax? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that so. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never read western comics so I wouldnt know. #$%
@#$ $#@ but saitama could kill them before they even do those #$%
@#$ $#@ Gold Experience Requiem could literally undo King Crimson's power to erase a frame of time that works on a Universal scale #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain how training causes baldness. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of flashes weakness is his predictability. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a picture where death-stroke sets explosives to make him run in a set path and eventually the flash runs into his sword. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you fight him in a narrow hallway theres really nothing else he can do besides run forward. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, sure he would rape god incarnate that can become OPM. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nonsense, The Flash can easily vibrate through walls. #$%
@#$ $#@ And this is all digital. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks fucking good, the weight of geno looks amazing in motion. #$%
@#$ $#@ he could vibrate though the walls, you're talking about a time when the flash jobbed SUPER hard and I don't think it was even canon #$%
@#$ $#@ lol no he wasnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all flashes are that smart. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably only barry would think of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ This isn't a philosophy discussion, take it to /lit/ #$%
@#$ $#@ No more than you could punch yourself to death #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds retarded, did Flash literally run at him with his eyes closed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise how would you not notice the sword pointing at you #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus christ Samus the fuck happened to your fusion suit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you are just making shit up. #$%
@#$ $#@ GER didnt do shit against Stairway to Heaven. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention you are thinking of the 'universe' in terms of your puny human brain. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have no proof it affect higher dimension. #$%
@#$ $#@ And the very fact that didnt EVEN affect anything from completely different universe is clear proof of its limitations. #$%
@#$ $#@ So yes to Asura, and Hulk, and Demon Bane who would actually scale better than OPM because they scale infinitely in their powers. #$%
@#$ $#@ The twist is that he has cancer and his greatest foe isnt a giant scary monster, rather his sickness. #$%
@#$ $#@ When you're going 'fast' I imagine it'd be hard to stop at a moments notice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the same kind of righting OPM has you fucking autist . #$%
@#$ $#@ And he wasnt even visibly winded after this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he was knocked to the moon once and just jumped back down no problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beerus, Omega Shenron is dead #$%
@#$ $#@ but he can hold his breath long enough to punch them afterwards #$%
@#$ $#@ He punched a planet bursting attack once. #$%
@#$ $#@ And before that he got kicked in the head so hard that he cratered into the moon and his only thought was "that jerk" #$%
@#$ $#@ He couldnt touch any of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is MadHouse going all out on this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Araki himself said the Worlds Time Stop has Universal Range. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see no reason it wouldnt be the same for King Crimson because their powers are almost identical. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's implied he wasn't affected by the reset also there are 26 Kars on Mars because of the resets #$%
@#$ $#@ Writing Saitama dead would just conjure a Saitama clone thats dead you retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could One Punch Man beat Two Punch Man? #$%
@#$ $#@ JORGE JOESTAR ISNT CANNON! #$%
@#$ $#@ He may be able to react to it, but that doesnt mean he can just stop or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's dumb as hell at times, so by the time he realised, he wouldn't be able to do anything, because physics are a thing that exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck kinda question is that. #$%
@#$ $#@ How would someone who has to use two punches to kill someone be stronger than a person who only has to punch once. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its OPM, with another punch just to be sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ all he has to do is bound toward the opponent by bouncing off one piece of debris. #$%
@#$ $#@ If we're throwing planetary destruction into the mix, I'm going to suspend the laws of physics for a second #$%
@#$ $#@ No thats just Deathstroke being bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Deathstrokes power is to make every superhero around him suddenly become a jobber to make Deathstroke look better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rance, He'll just rape Saitama and make him apart of his growing harem #$%
@#$ $#@ Both Wally and Barry can vibrate through things, only when Wally vibrates through shit it explodes. #$%
@#$ $#@ A ghost Pokemon #$%
@#$ $#@ Tons of universe puts 40k universe to shame. #$%
@#$ $#@ For example Xenosagas scale on EVERYTHING absolutely dwarfs Warhammer 40k. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon, Saitama might have Scrappy or Odor Sleuth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Genuinely curious. #$%
@#$ $#@ you and I both know his ability is huge power anon, lets be serious here #$%
@#$ $#@ just google it, it's not hard to find #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesnt need to beat OPM, he just has to dick him so good OPM falls in love with him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rance isnt gay though. #$%
@#$ $#@ more Deathstroke being consistently bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ a 4chan screencap isn't proof autismo, post a comic that says this and you might have a point #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally a non-canon story arc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Want to know how I know you didnt even read Kingdom Come? #$%
@#$ $#@ It exists and dc sells it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because it isnt a part of the main story doesnt mean it doesnt exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are any of the DBZ movies cannon, because their movie villains end up in some of their video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The one above all #$%
@#$ $#@ The One Above All #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to back to your containment general. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think you know what canon means. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn that sequel is a pile of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ but what if the goal is to lose then how exactly can cain succeed at that checkmate athiests #$%
@#$ $#@ times 10 iirc source: the radio playing some christian gospel thing at the old folk's home i work at #$%
@#$ $#@ You guys are just a higher tier of nerd than me to think what if stories are fan fiction even when they are sold by the company. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you feel about Marvel zombies when it was obviously a what if, but now they are really a part of the story? #$%
@#$ $#@ Btw hes in other stories too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Elseworld and 52 Multiverse, it says it in the bottom. #$%
@#$ $#@ What anime is that cheeki breeki looking guy from #$%
@#$ $#@ I never called them canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont see them as fan fiction so they are relevant to the thread, like Brolly would be for DBZ or even SSJ4 Goku. #$%
@#$ $#@ Many vidya characters are more based than Saitama #$%
@#$ $#@ he loses anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think you understand Kumagawa's character #$%
@#$ $#@ SI dont think you get Saitama. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if there is no logical way for him to win, he will win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because thats the joke. #$%
@#$ $#@ Read the original webcomic ONEs version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then read Muratas versionbetter art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then watch the anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its actually cannon in the Scribble Nauts universe that opening his notebook stops time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this by Murata or Toriyama? #$%
@#$ $#@ bitch slap i believe is forehand #$%
@#$ $#@ Pimp slap is the backhand so the rings hit #$%
@#$ $#@ ya learn something new every day #$%
@#$ $#@ Powerman cant beat mike lient. #$%
@#$ $#@ its john cena!!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ in your dream, Mr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck mosquitoes #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait im confused, does murata redraw within his own version or are you just saying muratas version is just the one version redrawn. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zero Punch Man would beat both of them #$%
@#$ $#@ lol and smh tbh fam #$%
@#$ $#@ yes they are #$%
@#$ $#@ power man is a pussy #$%
@#$ $#@ Fujiwara no Mokou #$%
@#$ $#@ You havent read the manga at all ahve you? #$%
@#$ $#@ tbh thats just because Deathstroke has ridiculously retarded plot armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ And this. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thing is ridiculous. #$%
@#$ $#@ the very existence of this comic undermines it's own premise lol #$%
@#$ $#@ Any transcendent being can easily beat GER because GERs power would be laughably primitive to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt Dark Schneider also have plot armor barrier along with all sort of other meta-hax? #$%
@#$ $#@ And the very fact that GER could be controlled by a human definitely means its potential is limited as hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Aleph. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rape is fine, mindbreak gangbangs are just garbage to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's 28 years old #$%
@#$ $#@ Sequel might have been better if it was Blizzard coming back for some more Baldy dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he's so great then why can't he create a real starite by writing starite? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes also pretty much immune to any attack be it mental, magical or physical. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes also completely invulnerable... #$%
@#$ $#@ for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ that running was rad as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Says the Pot to the Kettle. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think hes implying that only bald people can be perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is true in OPM, your limiter isn't disabled if you haven't gone bald. #$%
@#$ $#@ what was his name again? #$%
@#$ $#@ no because there's nothing supernatural about him #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 days in the GIMPo. #$%
@#$ $#@ YHVH cant do any of those things though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless hes hiding a body back in the multiverse. #$%
@#$ $#@ you do realize that arguing against Saitama is completely pointless right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youll never win you autist. #$%
@#$ $#@ People are just laughing at you, just stop. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Saitama would love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone who is moderately strong comes back only angrier and stronger? #$%
@#$ $#@ That is Saitamas dream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Asura and hulk have and can be defeated, half even sometimes when he really should have won hulk vs. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I dont know about demon bane so if you say so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Add a OPM frame #$%
@#$ $#@ Was a pretty fun episode 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Hmm, reminds me of... #$%
@#$ $#@ People said that about Proto-Jonathan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually Light skills do damage in general. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smirk adds a chance of instant death to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry it's probably just related to Protag himself since he has green tattoos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably has to kill and devour demons for magnetite. #$%
@#$ $#@ Magnetite isn't even that hard to manage and it makes sense that you shouldn't be able to just keep your demons out forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not? #$%
@#$ $#@ youre in Tokyo, demons are just out. #$%
@#$ $#@ It added a chance of instant death to Hama #$%
@#$ $#@ So Light and Dark are all normal spells now with only a chance for instant death? #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hope in Final they fix the goddamn fiend encounters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still have yet to add them to the original game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The music is great and putting them behind a crazy encounter rate hurts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks man, its even cooler than I imagined. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fiends should just be sidequest fights to unlock for fusion instead of rare encounters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mikado yes but you can totally walk around the top of the Sky Tower. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe they can just sense it, which ironically would make perfect sense with the moon phases switching like every minute with time above the roof being accelerated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, the fact they dont actually make a big deal out of the time dilation is the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ So many other games would make your characters seem retarded as they have it explained to their face and they act shocked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe the firmament gets removed early in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The giant Masakado was in the trailer. #$%
@#$ $#@ that reminds me, when the samurai go to tokyo does anyone in Mikado ever say that you've been gone for like a year or something #$%
@#$ $#@ SMTIV in general respects your intelligence a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a good bit of detail that's just hinted at. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing I remember is a samurai who says something like "I came back from Tokyo and my son had gotten way taller" #$%
@#$ $#@ His nephew #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it was bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ I laughed my ass off at how fucking dumb it was though so I got some fun out of the ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ White ending was a million times better than that because at least it was very realistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst law end will always and forever belong to Strange Journey #$%
@#$ $#@ my question is how were they able to contain the black hole so that it only swallowed tokyo and nothing else #$%
@#$ $#@ The White Ending was a better Law Ending than the Law Ending was #$%
@#$ $#@ We're having a good thread, just ignore Persona for now #$%
@#$ $#@ post skillsets #$%
@#$ $#@ Same way it worked in SJ #$%
@#$ $#@ They ate demons. #$%
@#$ $#@ The NPCs explain it once, that they eat demon meat. #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds like poop #$%
@#$ $#@ Since Jonathan died being fused into Merkabah, does that mean demons you fuse together die too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jonathan and Walter were more like catalysts for their sponsors to ascend to a higher form. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes :' #$%
@#$ $#@ Have they ever actually given any kind of explanation as to what demon fusion is anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does she wear the mask? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only Jonathan was a catalyst, Walter still existed inside Lucifer as his little buddy and could assume his form with it still being Walter. #$%
@#$ $#@ When Merkabah turned into Jonathan, it was just pretending because he outright died to allow the Archangels to fuse #$%
@#$ $#@ i'm only level 43 #$%
@#$ $#@ Jonathan speaks in the last bit of Merkabahs dialogue on Chaos, unable to comprehend that humans want to live like animals as animals do rape, murder, suicide, and kill for fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can choose your gender in If.. #$%
@#$ $#@ and the female one is canon since she appears in Persona 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ And Maya in EP as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were killed by Flynn before endgame. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if they respawn it will take some time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Medusa had to be revived by the Poly Gods for Final #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wonder what the hell happens to him and Isabeau #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh dang I meant this in relation to the White. #$%
@#$ $#@ So is it impossible to beat the game with a physical character? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure that was just a ruse #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a ruse. #$%
@#$ $#@ The three Reasons are all about submitting to the Great Will and creating a world with less freedom because freedom bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chaos bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ perfectly possible, its just that most people go for Magic since there's more skills to work with #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know what the worst thing there is, so I'm go with magic specialization bonuses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or maybe every route being Neutral #$%
@#$ $#@ Why couldnt we have had Walter as our ghost companion instead of Navarre? #$%
@#$ $#@ You idiots need to play the Raidou games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why couldnt we have had Issachar as our ghost companion instead of either of those two hacks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit I meant one VIT and the other AGI #$%
@#$ $#@ All the reasons were Law you faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you want to go southeast of Ginza or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ There should be a big highway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead of going over it, find the warehouse near it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The tunnel is the underpass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Head east from Ginza to a warehouse, and go in there. #$%
@#$ $#@ They better add a good number of new areas plus hopefully keep the previous ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because both sides have teamed up to oppose the Poly Gods and what happens when Law and Chaos join hands? #$%
@#$ $#@ You get Neutral. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd recommend getting some force resistance while you're at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both for demons and yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Sukukaja as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Belial outright calls out how Law has a social darwinist attitude of purging those who are weak and thus unworthy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Be is morally or otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why defeating him with brute force, the only way Law knows how to do things, proves that hes right in the end that Law isnt that different from them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Chaos allows even those weak to become strong enough to challenge those above and defeat them, while Laws hierarchy effectively sets you in your role for life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Law is a caste system, Chaos is what rich Americans pretend their economy is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon its an alliance of convenience. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once the enemy is dealt with its back to go old Chaos vs Law. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never played SJ but he seemed like an alright guy in 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people always post shit about him being untrustworthy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Law has all equal under God; thats why the caste system in Mikado was eliminated. #$%
@#$ $#@ and in DeSu2 you can argue they weren't going Law, Chaos or Neutral, but Capitalism, Communism, and fuck-all #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd be mad too if the guy who helped you seal away the archangels came to slay you, especially when you were merciful enough to let Gabriel go. #$%
@#$ $#@ You fight him? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is curious because you yourself also release the angels #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep watching it #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time I see that image, it immediately looks like Hero. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I just saw the title and replied, my bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like I said, he seemed like a good enough guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go for it #$%
@#$ $#@ Definitely do it, SMT 4 is a good starting point. #$%
@#$ $#@ The idea of the series is that there is a great war being waged between angels and demons and humanity is stuck in the middle of it all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you like turn-based JRPGs? #$%
@#$ $#@ If yes then it might hold your interest. #$%
@#$ $#@ If no then don't bother #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, whats that picture look like without the Deep Dream bullshit? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the Age of Mythology of Undertalelikes #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, depends. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to see demons be used as Arcanas from AH3 personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ That or Law/Chaos/Neutral variations like MKX. #$%
@#$ $#@ it´s a crime it doesn´t exist, many of the characters are more suited for a fighting game than persona´s #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah because these poly Gods think theyre some real tough guys interrupting a fight between Lucy and God. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, because that isn't worth it #$%
@#$ $#@ I gave up on that after trying to find Trumpeter for 2 hours straight and just finished the damn game #$%
@#$ $#@ YHVH is back? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm surprised they're getting away with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you mean "getting away with it"? #$%
@#$ $#@ YHVH was going to come back some time, he even says he will when he dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean a literal God that a large group of real people follow, not Vendictus Van Butthole from the Final Dragon Trigger series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I genuinely like 2D better than 3D in RPG #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course people are going to follow religion. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought there were 0 western sales last time, considering SMT II never got localized #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it did, but had an awful translation #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think any religious group has made a fuss over a video game in recent years, only thing I cant remember was the staged protest by EA to raise awareness for their shitty Devil may cry clone #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a "fan translation", do some research anon and also the translation is fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats part of the trailer gave me some Warcraft III final mission vibes. #$%
@#$ $#@ What deal? #$%
@#$ $#@ And even so there were NINE for Xbox and the GBA ports of SMT1 and SMT2. #$%
@#$ $#@ explain desu then #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes place in 4's world #$%
@#$ $#@ Subversive law propaganda #$%
@#$ $#@ Would people really do that, just go on the Internet and tell lies? #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesnt make any sense, Atlus made other games for the 3DS between SJ and IV. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are just a liar #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a separate deal for MegaTen in general. #$%
@#$ $#@ So same world and setting, but no relation to 4s events? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, its basically the same shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play SMT II. #$%
@#$ $#@ no, these are turn-based rpgs and not action rpg #$%
@#$ $#@ probably mushrooms or growlights. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think what he was going for with Chiaki is how shes highly bent on strong RULING the weak, not simply being better off than them. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Dark Souls of 4chan captions? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why am I seeing Rau Fetus-kun Creuset in a SMT thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ gotcha covered #$%
@#$ $#@ How can someone be this stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that what would happen in your typical SMT Chaos world anyway? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not all strong demons/people would just kill the weak, they would tyranically rule them as slaves or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mistakes were made. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks fam #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the typical is more existentialist than that, with the strong being highly capable, but necessarily having to, rule people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would serving the Lord in repelling the forces of Lucifer not be a good thing, son of man? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking this, why cant chaosfags understand? #$%
@#$ $#@ No is this /a/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Memery aside, several of these complaints are true even if most of them are retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't bother with void skills, you get a void all magatama later #$%
@#$ $#@ Minotaur is either ezpz or wipes your shit, depending on the dialogue you choose. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you get paired up with Walter during the fight, he's very lucky to use Agi against him and make him smirk, then he can crit your entire team to death in like 2 attacks #$%
@#$ $#@ Which game? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're a good guy anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Feel free to refute, dickface. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whered you see that ? #$%
@#$ $#@ The stream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Minotaur is a meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Skull Faces are. #$%
@#$ $#@ They even mention that specifically in audio logs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was because her skin was replaced with parasites because of her getting burnt the fuck up #$%
@#$ $#@ His parasites are more 'mature', but in turn are killing him a hell of a lot faster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because this game isn't meant for faggots that want to see burnt victims and old dudes in banana hammocks, queer #$%
@#$ $#@ Because Joost #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt that great, he literally was joking, like he said. #$%
@#$ $#@ Code Talker says that every single one of his internal organs were replaced by the parasites too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima openly admitted he wanted Quiet to be naked for perverse reasons. #$%
@#$ $#@ hot cosplayers, erotic, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ SJWs were the ones who took his "ashamed of your words &amp; deeds" to heart. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh man the creator of something wanted his creation to have an air of sexuality for his own enjoyment what a fucking womanizing garbage person omg #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont actually think different people see different things in Silent Hill, do you? #$%
@#$ $#@ They're not doing fucking acid, they're in a spooky cult town. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let me guess, your first Silent Hill was 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's saying ingame logic as in that's the reason the game explains it, the real reason is to have a half naked hot bitch as a main character. #$%
@#$ $#@ You idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ you conveniently forgot to address the second half of my point, fucko, that magical "parasites" somehow fix them but make it so she has to breathe through her skin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima has been a long standing pervert for ages, but for some reason he gets flack for it now in 2015. #$%
@#$ $#@ The more I see it the more I believe that MGSV is everyones first Metal Gear game. #$%
@#$ $#@ No complaints of his previous transgressions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone wanted to bully a japanese dev &amp; he wouldnt budge. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just read up on the plot of MGS5. #$%
@#$ $#@ So they aped Pontypool? #$%
@#$ $#@ actually, the point of silent hill is that everyone sees everything different. #$%
@#$ $#@ its based on the projection that they themselves put upon the town, which then manifests accordingly. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wrote this thinking you were serious, so if you were goofing around i apologize. #$%
@#$ $#@ Speak for yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ this guy knows whats up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone doesnt see everything different. #$%
@#$ $#@ If two people are in the same location they are going to see the exact same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ It creates things for you based on your subconscious mind but thats as far as it goes. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a case of "these things look different to me than they do to you" it's "this room was made for you, this room was made for me". #$%
@#$ $#@ He was literally 100% fucking with you, adding fuel to the fire for retards who think people see Silent Hill differently, and he was completely in on the fact that asshats like you would take the bait. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I'm sayin though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres shitloads of cute little perverse shit in all the MGS games, Ive grown up with it quite literally 20, and I really dont see why people gotta blow up churches cause a woman is sexy in an entertainment medium. #$%
@#$ $#@ when my girl dresses a little skimpy, I don't hear pedestrians tell me I'm mysog her, even if it was my request. #$%
@#$ $#@ i actually don't disagree with you and i think i spoke incorrectly because it has been a while since i've played any silent hill title. #$%
@#$ $#@ youre right, if two people are in the same location theyre going to see the same thing, but things like pyramid head are directly manifested from james head. #$%
@#$ $#@ i rewatched the cutscene and youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ seriously though, how can I farm adept female soldiers for the combat unit? #$%
@#$ $#@ look at those shit stats though #$%
@#$ $#@ Shota Mantis was moving my cock every time he appeared #$%
@#$ $#@ Because then they'd have to actually implement the fact that it's basically a nuclear bomb into the fight, rather than just alluding to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ hes a kid and we never see his face, regardless of what his eyes look like under the mask. #$%
@#$ $#@ How come you can get full clothes for her despite that description? #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanservice is heavy like E-Honda #$%
@#$ $#@ Minus the bra and its not far off from First Blood 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Landwhale SJW that drew this can btfo. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a girl right? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to protect Shota Mantis! #$%
@#$ $#@ He who touch sum yung boi be touched by big black man later. #$%
@#$ $#@ What if I am the bigger guy though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jade is Quiets real name? #$%
@#$ $#@ Was she a stripper or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Where was that mentioned? #$%
@#$ $#@ And Ritona is wearing a skirt for what reason? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes not navajo, she just knows how to speak navajo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats like saying a Chinese person can speak Welsh. #$%
@#$ $#@ I refuse to believe this is from kotaku, that guy sounds like hes having fun writing that article. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's before the SJW disease spread #$%
@#$ $#@ thats weird I just tried it and got a white, blonde hair s rank combat unit, gunman skill fem soldier with that one baby faced model. #$%
@#$ $#@ DD user #$%
@#$ $#@ In all my attempts just got one white fem soldier. #$%
@#$ $#@ now the mission gives me like 11k as a reward. #$%
@#$ $#@ How long until the reward balances itself? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its b8, he doesn't know either #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh okay, sorry for insulting that, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ They can, unless they were infected with the WELSH STRAIN #$%
@#$ $#@ Its her name tag on her XOF suit. #$%
@#$ $#@ James Bond type rules? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima said it in a tweet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also her age is 28. #$%
@#$ $#@ still no source there buddy #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont need a source to prove what is an assumed fact. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes you do #$%
@#$ $#@ Did anyone else see this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was turned on at first #$%
@#$ $#@ then where did the burgers go when he ate them? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do [Extreme] Back Up, Back Doem #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, I legitimately thought thats what it was until I saw your picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ Working for fucking Cipher, servers you well #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah and I'm getting rid of wandering puppets so shit doesn't help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man MGS shouldn't be this scary wtf #$%
@#$ $#@ kojima's birthday #$%
@#$ $#@ literally fucking nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ this man is no ruse master. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you play that tape to enemy soldiers they get spooked. #$%
@#$ $#@ it didnt gave me the option to take the tape. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont wanna go back there #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you rike it? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can find it other places, dont worry. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't take the tape there, the numbered tape is found in a outpost near the mine's I think #$%
@#$ $#@ Because muh womens must be represented according to the new SJW doctrine and we will not BE SILENCED. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because why would a woman ever fight in tight, revealing clothing? #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how there were like 20 separate cassettes over-explaining this bullshit and saying the same thing over and over like it made it any more feasible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yet we get entire other fucking plot points dropped completely. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a big fucking difference between a skimpy bikini with cut up pantyhose, and gym shorts and a bra. #$%
@#$ $#@ One covers more? #$%
@#$ $#@ And his point is that no matter what you wear that doesn't mean you can't fight or shoot. #$%
@#$ $#@ DId you complain during the John Wick movie and say why is he wearing a suit?! #$%
@#$ $#@ He has a gun! #$%
@#$ $#@ He sold be in a police officers suit or in full body armor like a marine! #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, Quiets outfit is especially retarded, even for MGS standards. #$%
@#$ $#@ There also werent any other named female characters to balance her out. #$%
@#$ $#@ So what, its a videogame, a weeb bideogame. #$%
@#$ $#@ Skull Face keeps getting Daily Dosed with patasite strains, to the point he cannot die. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres lots of things retarded in mgsv, and mgs series as a whole. #$%
@#$ $#@ People are focusing on the retarded thing that has to do with a woman though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could it be that SJW/FEMINISM cancer thats been plaguing gaming for the past couple years now? #$%
@#$ $#@ yes I think that would be it #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure its not cannon big boss or venom snake goes out in the battlefield painted in gold or silver though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then it works for quiets character as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a psychic soldier can wear a gas mask and a skin tight suit then she can wear a bra and tights. #$%
@#$ $#@ The twist could have been much better if it was blatantly spoiled in the first trailers #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is stupid because of a girl dressed in a way you dont like? #$%
@#$ $#@ You sound stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ So you are going to compare all of those to a girl in bikini? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im wondering if you also complained about the half naked inmortal vampire who had a knife symbolizing his dick in MGS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because men want to have a knife for a penis. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a fucking faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ He wasnt even burning up. #$%
@#$ $#@ And why Major anyway? #$%
@#$ $#@ Major Zero #$%
@#$ $#@ He had nothing to do with anything there. #$%
@#$ $#@ I read that its a japanese pun that roughly means "look in the bathtub" #$%
@#$ $#@ Valid points: the post. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Troy Bakers Ocelot IS boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, you said you had 100 hundred, and those barely count. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh god, whoops. #$%
@#$ $#@ Misread Ocelot as Otacon, in which that would have been a typo for Huey. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which doesnt make sense anyway because Huey had the most development in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck me #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm starting to doubt if you even played the game #$%
@#$ $#@ Portable Op did it well when you would infiltrate a base with a soldier from that base. #$%
@#$ $#@ You would be undetected so long as a soldier wasnt staring at you from up close. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how a bunch of faggots basically ruined your list and discussion about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, not gonna lie, Im getting pretty low on material anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nips ruin everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because that hack Kojima wanted to give you some contrived reason to show off some digital boobs to a bunch of sad autists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Many of whom are on this board right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have PS+. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone else will have to comment on the online stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that it has microtransactions is pretty bullshit though. #$%
@#$ $#@ The lack of things that made it over from previous installments then. #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe in you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did it once and found a man instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stats scale by heroism score. #$%
@#$ $#@ Samurai does shit that makes sense to him and no one else. #$%
@#$ $#@ But if people accepted it for a robot ninja that can cut steel like butter on a hot afternoon, why cant they accept Quiets? #$%
@#$ $#@ It just seems wrong to me that they hate her just because she wears a bra. #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems like people focus more on a optional companion then the game itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ He couldve removed a lot for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally I thought she was a good character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her and D-Dog where very good companions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its stupid? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know what else you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is it stupid? #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks stupid comparatively to Big Boss running around with literally any of his costumes on. #$%
@#$ $#@ She just looks like some chick going to the beach or something, not like a badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre judging her not what she does in the game but what she has on in the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most action movies has anyone in the right apparel expecially when it comes to shooting scenes I.e. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taken or John Wick. #$%
@#$ $#@ All because they wear something not appropriate for that situation doesnt make them less badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do I need to remind you that you could play the entire Peace Walker campaign with Big Boss on shorts, and he would shout ''I love the beach!'' everytime you deployed? #$%
@#$ $#@ BB shorts isn't the default, canon costume though #$%
@#$ $#@ So what if its the default canon costume? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, good points. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ If youd actually read what I was saying. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they were any good at their jobs it wouldnt matter if they wore nametags. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one cared who he was, until he put on the mask. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or maybe Quiet just kind of sucks as a character and its apparent kojima had her around to dance around in mo cap suits for his own kicks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss the barrel, inchworming, soldiers fighting other soldiers, grass folding under you, swimming, targeting enemies limbs, shooting out radios, and getting peed on. #$%
@#$ $#@ From what weve been shown, it would have had them kill him painfully through weird mutations. #$%
@#$ $#@ But he was clearly running around alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because we expected more, but MGSV apparently failed to deliver in a multitude of ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you expect more from the same guys who wrote MGS4 and PW? #$%
@#$ $#@ I gave out my reasoning from a character perspective, not from what she is wearing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Peace Walker was surprisingly good though. #$%
@#$ $#@ how the fuck do you get the shower scene to happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont switch armor or shower ever and i havent gotten it in 100 hours #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't clean the blood off of you #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why I said suggested filing it down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldnt that cause it to jiggle around more in his noggin? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga where is the mouth #$%
@#$ $#@ How about we discuss best malefus #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant go wrong with Selene. #$%
@#$ $#@ She makes every romance much better. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game is the most overhyped on /v/, you know. #$%
@#$ $#@ People say its the best shit ever, but the only thing it has going for it is a combat system, that while fun, does not make up for the shitty story, and pace of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Designing your waifu is not bad I suppose. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucked that pretty boi in Cassardis that you have to keep giving herbs to before he dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best boy by a large margin. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he's talking about Valmiro #$%
@#$ $#@ What is this from, a quiz? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted a much larger wilted forest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nuh uh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modding wouldve. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nude mod even #$%
@#$ $#@ Is her porn good #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it would have been nice, would have also been nice if it had region exclusive monsters like Snow Harpies are to the Northface Forest #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone answer this man's plea, we're more than one individual waiting #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone have the artbook concept art for the harpies? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit was terrifying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not how Dogma works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe you have a better comparison method. #$%
@#$ $#@ These pics makes me want to play Dogma again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats cool and all but I actually meant the one that shows their skeletal structure. #$%
@#$ $#@ wow i'm THAT guy #$%
@#$ $#@ I always thought Selene was pretty boring so I always end up with Jewtits and Shegoat #$%
@#$ $#@ Bat wings tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quina is my favorite actually #$%
@#$ $#@ Just pick a vocation, there done, Dragons Dogma classes in a nutshell. #$%
@#$ $#@ The purest #$%
@#$ $#@ I always had a thing for childhood friends thanks to my Chinese cartoons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like a fighting game, you pick your main by play style. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can pretend to be any kind of special snowflake you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ January, do you live under a rock? #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt want to be human. #$%
@#$ $#@ wow I got the thing that I am #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy knows. #$%
@#$ $#@ The last thread made it way over bump limit and passed away on P10 with dignity, dumb OP #$%
@#$ $#@ Sup true neutral bros. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt theyll change anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was already "fixed" with Dark Arisen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ferrystones are dirt cheap now and you have one stone set at both Gran Soren / Cassardis #$%
@#$ $#@ Faggots destroy everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont D&amp;D, how is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully someone makes an unofficial patch that does all of those things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im fairly sure someone is gonna make a YOU NEED TO SHUT THE FUCK UP mod for the pawns, probably second mod to be released, right after the nude mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ Third mod probably the mod to change every single enemy death sound into THEY'RE MASTERWORKS ALL, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG #$%
@#$ $#@ Im guessing Mage because of my goodie-two-shoe nature. #$%
@#$ $#@ What has been destroyed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Stay madelusional #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck would a bard be in DD? #$%
@#$ $#@ Complete mediocrity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also fuck, meant Mystic Knight #$%
@#$ $#@ Look Arisen, a chair! #$%
@#$ $#@ We might find aught of use! #$%
@#$ $#@ I find that extremely unlikely. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to do lots of stuff to get jewtits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Additionally there are many other characters you are more like to get max bond with and speak to before you go to the great wall encampment. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people got Fornival, Caxton, or Japesguy on their first go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im some sort of arcane archer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bretty cool, considering Mystic Archer was shitloads of fun in DD. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got her on my first playthrough too and didnt really go out of my way to do anything special or give her anything special. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt really even know how affections worked in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't wait to romance Mercedes with my character that is also Mercedes wearing Mercedes' armor while his pawn Mercedes watches. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rev up those maces, MK here I come! #$%
@#$ $#@ I am the jack of all trades, master of none! #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes sense that I tend to play mages/casters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would actually be fun, give Fighter Gouge too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want two additional slots for the roar and catapult blade, fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ It would make Warrior pawns less useless, even though for melee the Strider is unmatched...for a pawn anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those blades that lower defence...nasty when used with Thousand Kisses #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess Ill just be a socially awkward but somehow endearing Sorcerer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Magic users are rarely leaders anyway, Ill just make my pawn a giant onee-san tank that takes care of me while I cast spells in the back. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's worth Immolating yourself at least once as a fatass and grabbing a griffin JUST ONCE for the buffalo wings you get afterwards #$%
@#$ $#@ What is packs for 2000 riftsluts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fucking perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why am I a Half-Elf? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the spirit, now onward and upward! #$%
@#$ $#@ We'll waifu Selene and she'll make us custard! #$%
@#$ $#@ what the shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Alrighty then #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes unless they die or you send them back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im fucking dying with this thread, this spilled the vase. #$%
@#$ $#@ My sides. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your words are quite harsh, but I am unshaken, a few trips to /vg/ and your homolust will awaken. #$%
@#$ $#@ For our love is pure, like a bird flying free, and you shall be the one, who doesn't fit in /ddg/ #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea what Im doing. #$%
@#$ $#@ IT'S WEAK TO FIRE #$%
@#$ $#@ Lucky for you, when I started I hired pawns from the rift. #$%
@#$ $#@ You guessed it, they know fuck all and does nothing in combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shouldnt have made me laugh like it did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, that's just lightining-flavored immolation #$%
@#$ $#@ Brontide doesn't count #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the best lightning spell in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ But its not the same as summoning a lightning storm that blackens the sky and tracks enemies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its still the ultimate lightning spell. #$%
@#$ $#@ ur so chaotic #$%
@#$ $#@ If you can't figure out what to answer when the question doesn't fully apply to you, you should drop your Wis and Int by 4-5 points. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats the name of this quiz or whatever? #$%
@#$ $#@ All Capcom means is better graphics and thats it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt imply more in any way when a pc port is announced. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously I did figure it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ I picked the lowest or socially expected 'worst' answer in each case to be safe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its in the post that guy replied to. #$%
@#$ $#@ It comes out in January #$%
@#$ $#@ The worst one was probably Revelations 2 but I dont think they did that. #$%
@#$ $#@ If someone else is porting it, then itll be playable at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of them have been fucking awful? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is Capcom were talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe not quite Koei Tecmo, but still. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with Revelations 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ Laggy as hell? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a japanese game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most japanese, dont care about PC and just occasionally throw games to steam that sold poorly on console to get more money. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dogmas PC port is held by QLOC and they have a history of decent ports with Capcom games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frame issues and I dont know if they patched it but aiming was fucking awful. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was the kind that accelerated as you move the camera. #$%
@#$ $#@ God, Im plain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a controller, seriously. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why dont you have one already? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh alright I kinda wanted to play it again on PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ lucky fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ did i do good??? #$%
@#$ $#@ Suggest me. #$%
@#$ $#@ it was pretty cool until all the True Neutral edgy fags showed up. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are the BBEG with those stats. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah fuck you, not that I care what you think anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a good spin to it, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I gotta think of a way to systematically oppress the populace and cause an uprising so I can weed out the heroes. #$%
@#$ $#@ You realize outside of HP and stamina theres no reason to care about stats, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Upgrade equipment trumps any kind of atk. #$%
@#$ $#@ or def. #$%
@#$ $#@ stat obtained from leveling classes #$%
@#$ $#@ they were cute #$%
@#$ $#@ The teaching goes a lot faster if youre the same class. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just dont play bad or they will end up copying you doing bad things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I can go to sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ I usually play spellcasters in games. #$%
@#$ $#@ go figure. #$%
@#$ $#@ RED STRONG #$%
@#$ $#@ Jewtits is one of the last people game has you speaking with, along with the princess, if you had been doing your quests. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why werent there skelly harpies in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is terrifying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Soo, im a magic user, thats my favorite class, thats neat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does DDO still have pawns? #$%
@#$ $#@ Got a pretty nice stat role. #$%
@#$ $#@ I should multi class in to everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really do say I dont care a lot, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ People describe me as apathetic and cold. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that sounds edgy but hey. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now do it on PS3 #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't play anything else right now because I'm too excited. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive just been trying to master the character creator. #$%
@#$ $#@ We've all been there, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ I would if mine hadnt been stolen. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least I got my favorite spell casting class. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck preparing spells #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sure your pawn is in my favorites list in one of my two accounts. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this good or bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just hire old pawns you like, do a run. #$%
@#$ $#@ post some then #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the fastest way to farm BBI gear? #$%
@#$ $#@ Steal from the condemned Gorecyclops? #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its just the power supply. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant decide what to make my pawn for PC release. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either the same Fighter Griffith, Aniki or a random brown girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you even search pawn names? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see an option. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would post his PSN id, but that'll be rude to the guy since maybe he doesn't want it known. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, a boring Mystic Knight who just hits things? #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Delicious brown #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I wouldnt either. #$%
@#$ $#@ The quests were very bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better bring it back for the PC release. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, the bloody knuckle. #$%
@#$ $#@ It needs to be way more powerful though i think. #$%
@#$ $#@ To make up for the fact that ring slots are pretty valuable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now post the death comic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, that was fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ A neutral paladin, how does that even work? #$%
@#$ $#@ Belief in oneself I suppose, which is bad since I dont have much faith in myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I got true neutral bard and I generally dont care about shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe the pally in you is just more loyal as a friend or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh haha is that rule 63 Dante from the Devil May Cry series? #$%
@#$ $#@ she was a brat for the most time of the books that thought she was hot shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ but she had her cute moments with geralt and yennefer #$%
@#$ $#@ Speaking of whiny bitch characters that act like children. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is extremely interesting in the books. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is a shite charcter, and the only reason some people like he is that she is a pretty girl, plus the meta worship of her while she was missing from the past two games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know... #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you like her? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont ask us to spoon feed you opinions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Polish voice is better #$%
@#$ $#@ she was daughter bait like the girl from the last of us. #$%
@#$ $#@ u wot, she has that tattoo from the books m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Good job exposing you havent played the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes literally the worst thing that happened to books. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's edgier than donte and raiden jack the ripper combined #$%
@#$ $#@ nah he's just stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Merely Pretending.jpg #$%
@#$ $#@ Nerminding that the way you have to get the good ending is by having Geralt act like a complete fucking moron. #$%
@#$ $#@ he died by his Viagra before he could get it in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what she did afterwards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad she is a lesbo #$%
@#$ $#@ Just fuck a female elf or masturbate until youre about to come and then stick it in her when you do come, not fucking hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The real question is, will she ever be a playable character? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because in TW universe only white people exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ebin, memester. #$%
@#$ $#@ She would be kinda boring to play as considering how overpowered she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fam witcher 3 is my shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Ayyyy lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like bobbi starr with white hair tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ I really dont think he would be, not on a conscious level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very doubtful. #$%
@#$ $#@ He sees her as his daughter, especially since witchers are sterile so he cant have a proper kid of his own. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ciri's the closest thing he'll ever have. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would like to play as a younger Ciri. #$%
@#$ $#@ you implying thats a bad thing anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ why do they have to be ethnic? #$%
@#$ $#@ why cant they just be people? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit she does. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the expansion that releases tomorrow has some people from Serikanien? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id treat her like an adult if you catch my drift. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont get it for a console. #$%
@#$ $#@ Base Skyrim is flat out boring to play without a good 40+ mods installed and I feel it will be the same for Fallout 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, why do other people want to buy it? #$%
@#$ $#@ good mods wont come out until the ck does, and fuck knows how long beth is gonna sit on it or how crippled its going to be this time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would be a perfect christmas present for japs #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of cake do they get anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ Retarded simplification. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about you play games that arent crap? #$%
@#$ $#@ But youre a Bethesdacuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ sure, Todd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ More Todd memes, please. #$%
@#$ $#@ yea man, i wish i could be hardcore like you and play it on PC xD #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have money or space for a desktop PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rooms in Japan are small. #$%
@#$ $#@ mini-ITX is a thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ No excuses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus having a PC is gaming and 4chan funposting machine in one. #$%
@#$ $#@ No need for a shitty, under powered console and an even shittier laptop. #$%
@#$ $#@ I´m in two minds about it as well; on one hand it is made by fucking JJ Abrams, who has not made a good anything since always, on the other hand Disney is certain to make better movies than George Lucas. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure there'll be a mute mod within the first week. #$%
@#$ $#@ the modding kit wont be out until early next year. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly dont understand why this bothers anyone. #$%
@#$ $#@ It got postponed to December. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ruins the RP which is pretty autistic tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Then the ad in OP is made up? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit do you not see the moon runes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure it's just delayed in japan cause they are removing some nuking or nuke reference #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully in time for my birthday in january. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont need to be white! #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play the race card and blame racism for all your issues! #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy seems pretty based #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe this asshat will learn not to say stupid things when you dont have anonymity. #$%
@#$ $#@ He sure looks overworked with all his selfies and smug giggling to himself constantly. #$%
@#$ $#@ You say all that but then you shill your fucking video here anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off already, you even made this thread before too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who gets that excited over burgers and fries #$%
@#$ $#@ He is pretty cute tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ No homo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably thought he was getting laid and took the selfie/posted it rapidly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its a title and not a person. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like big boss or james bond #$%
@#$ $#@ LOOK AT ME I'M SO WACKY AND TWISTED FUCK THE MAN #$%
@#$ $#@ Did youtube or the term indie even exist when he was a child? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, sorry about the male pattern baldness, bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ for real? #$%
@#$ $#@ the shit I did on rpg maker 2k looked better than that #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt the game his college project? #$%
@#$ $#@ These just make his firey collapse sweeter. #$%
@#$ $#@ I already know that just by looking at his face #$%
@#$ $#@ Even the cicadas know his presentation is boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's comedy gold, i hope he makes more #$%
@#$ $#@ is he famous yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ The man is suffering some intense loss #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is this thing?! #$%
@#$ $#@ me tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ when the ea_spouse blog made the rounds #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds like it'll only highlight how low quality the sprites are #$%
@#$ $#@ Share with the class, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ When even more activists took the video game craze. #$%
@#$ $#@ How far are you with you project? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, with the company he keeps you can guarantee he at least has herpes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard to give a percentage, as everything is basically done planning wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like I said before its really just waiting on the artist to do art stuff, so I can properly translate it all into the program. #$%
@#$ $#@ but anon making indie game means internet drama #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds hot #$%
@#$ $#@ Many don't, you just don't see pictures of them online. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jeremy piven makes games? #$%
@#$ $#@ should it be a punishable crime for indie devs to run off with money for a game they put on kick starter and not meeting the deadlines they set? #$%
@#$ $#@ Neat, sounds kind of like Okage then. #$%
@#$ $#@ No but I might shitpost about it, whether pretending to be a fan or a hater, either works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the game actually good? #$%
@#$ $#@ didnt she leave her dog out in the middle of the night during winter and then it died and she made a huge blog post lamenting the loss of her pet but not actually admitting she killed it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck what is his problem? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know who this guy is much less give a fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then she made a fake account using her dead dog's picture to false flag herself #$%
@#$ $#@ Not in Alabama. #$%
@#$ $#@ do you have screencaps? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think she deleted it before I could see. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, IF I DONT FUCKING GET BANNED FOR THEM. #$%
@#$ $#@ That last one is the Jabberwock from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just goes to show that every single indieshit fuck is completely unoriginal, even the ones found on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats because she uses body doubles to protect herself from the evil goober gabbers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every new photo is proof of a failed assassination #$%
@#$ $#@ Changed the clothes and the hair, what else is there to do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just concept art anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you draw porn on the side anon #$%
@#$ $#@ This actually hurts to look at #$%
@#$ $#@ What about a different kind of spider like a big fluffy tarantula? #$%
@#$ $#@ So are you ideas guy then #$%
@#$ $#@ I was just trying to create a character within the same species. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its concept art, the whole point is for it to be a rough draft to hammer out the issues. #$%
@#$ $#@ He has brain fungus, apparently. #$%
@#$ $#@ It shipped in from his asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ what makes me laugh is that nobody in this thread and most likely on /v/ has backed that guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody gives a remote fuck about the dude but since youve got nothing better to discuss on /v/ and non vidya is deleted, then you talk about him and what he should be doing and how he should be doing it and what he should be saying and how he should be saying it and blablabla. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking worse than SJW. #$%
@#$ $#@ Browsing /v/ has become such a bore lately, nothing but e-celebs and twitter threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bro no. #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy is an indie dev funded by kickstarter which means you should be glad he even graced you with the idea of this game being a thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ How DARE you expect any progress to be made you entitled cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ why is this 40 year old man acting like a child? #$%
@#$ $#@ I need to ask because I see it all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ He didnt really make a new stretch goal for bail money right? #$%
@#$ $#@ He was joking right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does anyone else think his head proportions look a bit off like the dudes from Road Rash? #$%
@#$ $#@ undertale sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Course not, but the problem is that he's using an almost entirely traced version of it for use in his own work and then claiming "b-b-but I'm not actually ripping it the fuck off honest!". #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats like somebody trying to make an original platformer game but then it has straight up goombas in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get a "Jeremy Piven with down syndrome" feeling from him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitch, that last Npc design is a blatant rip off of the monster echlopedias JabberWoch. #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesn't really look like Zoe Quinn #$%
@#$ $#@ Im kinda in disbelief over how mad this guy is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like cactus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad he hasnt done anything recently since the Hotline Miami games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Many many people disagree, you may feel that it sucks but it succeeded in what it was trying to be and is probably massively profitable and will continue to siphon money into the devs hands. #$%
@#$ $#@ It does not suck, as a fact. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont like it either but its clearly succeeded in what it was trying to be and many people love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Our opinions are like that of anita, irrelevant and wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ increpare, he can come up with pretty fun mechanics for his little games #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah thats what i thought, youre nothing but a hater who is just jealous that im doing something productive and great in life while youre on 4chan bitching at others success. #$%
@#$ $#@ stay mad in your quiet rage while i keep working towards my dream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im actually upset at how ugly that game is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did this guy bother to look at the other homebrew hed be competing with? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dreamcast has a ton of stuff still being made that could have been a full retail release in 1999. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the LISA guy #$%
@#$ $#@ make it lewd please #$%
@#$ $#@ No thanks, my current artist is a professional with a degree. #$%
@#$ $#@ I put my full faith into him and his work, and I will stand by his concept art no matter how much hate it gets on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are..are you actually promoting my game for me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah he tweeted that Nicalis gives him a fair cut of the money. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's more likely that after the wiiware version there wasn't much in actual sales happening so by Cave Story+ the most he was making was probably just a pittance at best. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should also check out his new game he made after Kero Blaster, he launched it on 9/11 just like the Mario. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, don't judge, We're all artists on the inside man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you never hear of Undertale the greatest underdog story ever made? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit dude I'd call you a newfag but even that's giving you too much credit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Here's your You #$%
@#$ $#@ All this does is prove there the designs are very different. #$%
@#$ $#@ The face, arms/claws,, tail, clothing, and the extra heads dont bare any resemblance whatsoever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gabe Newell. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont understand the whole Zoe Quinn thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Has she ever even made anything for real? #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems like all she does is run around talking about how shes a game developer without ever developing games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a trace, but inspiration was clearly taken from it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its likely the artist used it as a reference when drawing, the only things that were probably traced were the body, arms wings and maybe the claw feet. #$%
@#$ $#@ the rest is tacked on lazily. #$%
@#$ $#@ yea not a trace but clearly COPIED, not inspired. #$%
@#$ $#@ He could have easily changed the way the twin monster heads looked, or maybe used a different pattern besides checkered? #$%
@#$ $#@ He could have made the ears different, he could have changed the design of the wings even TINY BIT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ she made an interactive HTML document and fucked a bunch of "journalists", then played the victim card when people called her out for it #$%
@#$ $#@ Depression Quest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Zoe has finished more projects than that douche poser. #$%
@#$ $#@ does he get to keep the money if he doesnt finish it? #$%
@#$ $#@ you have bad eyes then, get them checked out #$%
@#$ $#@ That was like several years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ So no she doesn't actually make games is the answer I'm getting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not sure why people believe that game development has to be some dog &amp; pony show now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool story cuz. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not it obviously works for people like her. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have to do anything but proclaim about how hard you're working and everyone buys it. #$%
@#$ $#@ So long as someone else is around actually making video games theres plenty of other people talking about how much theyre doing for the industry and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ you mean like Cave Story? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont hate him I just wish hed take the advice from people in this thread telling him to drop the guy hes paying to do concept art. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's not only getting played like a fiddle but it's also just a bad sign if someone is that blatantly copying something. #$%
@#$ $#@ rapid weight change can really affect how people look #$%
@#$ $#@ Because why exactly? #$%
@#$ $#@ i doubt they anyone involved in barkley or barkley 2 would ever call themselves indie devs though, as they're not faggots #$%
@#$ $#@ he is a good man #$%
@#$ $#@ hey, that's the dilbert guy #$%
@#$ $#@ he made barkley: shut up and jam gaiden, the best rpgmaker game ever made. #$%
@#$ $#@ As someone who doodles shitty shit, art is hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think of it like this, have you ever hated someone at work and couldnt wait to finish your shift and get away from them? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well imagine if you couldn't leave work and you lived there and couldn't escape them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats smart thinking. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy fuck i havent seen anyone talk or mention this particular version of road rash, ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ not sure why, that game was fucking awesome #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh no, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being a developer is very much still viable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately, youre a talentless piece of shit so you would just be another faggotdev in the pile. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just focus on making THE GAME instead of the publicity. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait wes wilson? #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt he only known for managing a bunch of minecraft youtubers? #$%
@#$ $#@ They probably read about iD software doing it and thought they could do the same thing #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a big girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ And this is why I dont bother with kickstarter, what a lazy asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, but it works on idiots who will literally throw themselves at you financially/emotionally. #$%
@#$ $#@ just make a free game/mod/map in your free time and viral the shit out of it on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once some guy made a minimalist instangibs fpsthe pill shooter and people would play that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ a good game is a good game no matter how it get done. #$%
@#$ $#@ just make a good game and none of it applies to you #$%
@#$ $#@ cactus, dingaling, toby, pixel, barkley team are good, and also made good games. #$%
@#$ $#@ notch did bad things but i don't think he's a bad person #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll probably try to piss off the fanbase anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ Undertale gives you your answer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, nevermind. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt know Toby had a kickstarter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that basically Tower of Guns? #$%
@#$ $#@ shiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeet it pretty much is but a different style. #$%
@#$ $#@ i was thinking like, a real building highrise you go up levels in, and real guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you go to blowjob town, expect to suck a lot of dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ You and your artist are under the age of 22 arent you? #$%
@#$ $#@ You could viral it here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Word of mouth is a powerful thing if played right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes dumpy. #$%
@#$ $#@ She can keep all the fat out of the shot if its all in the hips. #$%
@#$ $#@ She wasnt given time to prepare, have the camera taken at an angle to hide any fatness, and edit her pictures/some edit it for her. #$%
@#$ $#@ its while hes actually being booked too #$%
@#$ $#@ If you are going to sell you dick-sucking soul like that, you better do it for a fucking yacht or something better instead of a shitty game you fucking homo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pixel, ZUN and Yacht Club come to mind. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, thats clearly a shrine for Mass Effect 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Hank the Chog had more work put in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always forget. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that just a giant fucking mole on her cheek, or is that a piercing? #$%
@#$ $#@ I laugh at every retard who funded this sjws kickstart. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kaiji taught me that theres no luck in gambling, only tactics and predictions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pixel, the guys that made La-Mulana, Dennaton, whoever made Axiom Verge, and Toby Fox. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you got to scam, at least do it big #$%
@#$ $#@ anyone have more details on the guy that stole the money? #$%
@#$ $#@ If its true, the guy stealing is pretty based, i wanna congratulate him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't drop their stealing friends #$%
@#$ $#@ ask for a refund because your arist ripped something else off #$%
@#$ $#@ and it took him ONE YEAR to figure this shit out? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is already enough to accuse him of mishandling backers money, i would love to see someone suing this cocksucker #$%
@#$ $#@ it could also just be the video is some queermo faggot with an anal infection crying giant bitch tears about things that didnt happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ So whatever happened to fish nowadays? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he is a music DJ #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know his name but I've been playing his game for almost a third of my life. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only know him as ToadyOne. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes looking at that cat thinking If I had one more of these I could ruin everything forever! #$%
@#$ $#@ He got a new haircut, became a dj for one night stream, and then he disappeared. #$%
@#$ $#@ Occasionally pops up on twitter to remind everyone that its our fault his life sucks, no Fez 2, and we're all shit eaters and that he's best. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, you're so fucked, there's no possible solution for lack of experience in a subject, it's just not fair how some people come out of the womb with so much programming experience #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of game is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Animations can use some work and that train engine is god awful #$%
@#$ $#@ thats literally what he says in every video. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a first person puzzle game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Each train car has its own little puzzle that you solve to advance. #$%
@#$ $#@ This gifs a little old, I've since added autotype to the text and the puzzle is mostly completed but you can see whats going on #$%
@#$ $#@ BABA YETU YETU ULIYE! #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering the theme of the thread, its ironic that a fairly decent road rash spiritual successor was kickstarted. #$%
@#$ $#@ It could be better and the roguelike bullshit is tacked on as hell, it would be a lot better with prebuilt tracks, but its still a fun game and it feels like road rash which more than any other game has done in years. #$%
@#$ $#@ There should be an option to kill that Pac Man ghost and a puppy thanks you for doing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you arent implying pick up the box and throw it off is a puzzle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok so theyre not all puzzles per se, just different tasks to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop grilling me mom #$%
@#$ $#@ How does indie game dev manage to cost that much? #$%
@#$ $#@ Like what do they even spend it on? #$%
@#$ $#@ dead people is famous, so, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ But graphics don't matter, it's all about the deep storyline and innovative rpg gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the other guys said about the DJ thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what I remember hearing. #$%
@#$ $#@ He periodically spergs out and goes white knight mode for people like Zoe Quinn and other retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ do it anon, at least you have ideas and know coding, don't be like me, i'm uninspired and know shit, follow your dreams anon, you could make Undertale 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ hi tobbey #$%
@#$ $#@ dont wory anon i will make a speritule sesesr gib me monys #$%
@#$ $#@ Download gamemaker and learn their pseudo language. #$%
@#$ $#@ Start small like 2d platforming and kill yourself if you are too stupid for that because their are 1000s of videos on how to make those in GM. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to fuck that bee. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes also had a small cult following since 2007 and did 6 months of interviews, but yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much that easy and any random nobody could make half of what he did as long as youre loud on the internet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really want some fucking porn of that bee #$%
@#$ $#@ People from Crate are the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ They update their game earlier than announced and are very professional. #$%
@#$ $#@ Suck my dick, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why doesnt he kickstart a better rpg maker instead of a game? #$%
@#$ $#@ present your cock anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Present this *whips out dick* #$%
@#$ $#@ So what are you suggesting? #$%
@#$ $#@ That devs should just get jobs to pay for their living expenses instead of working full time on the games they promised? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact he made this video shows how assblasted he is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope youre post was just doing that hipster irony thing because if you seriously think its a good idea to give financially unstable people your hard earned dollar then you should just stop posting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what AIDS does to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pixel, Endless Fluff, and he who consorts with beasts #$%
@#$ $#@ The only gameplay that has been shown is basically every mediocre/generic adventure game on ps1, a la Alundra, except with even more uninspired monsters such as GREEN SLIME #$%
@#$ $#@ Just as long as you keep it fresh and have a unique experience to offer, it doesnt necessarily matter if it has the same style. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, have you counted how many stories have "Magic" in them? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a very old idea/style but it keeps selling today, you just need to be creative #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing in this thread is against the rules. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shitty ripoff of a better game, now with a great cast of animals-- I mean demons. #$%
@#$ $#@ did you ignore all the other guy indie fuckers that act just like that #$%
@#$ $#@ did the console versions have the faces and characters? #$%
@#$ $#@ i only played that one, way back when. #$%
@#$ $#@ still got a fucked up disc of it somewhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ really gotta dump and iso all my old cd`s #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta pay for rent and food to live. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't develop games if you aren't alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ In an ordinary company developers get paid a salary on contract. #$%
@#$ $#@ They spend their pay on rent and food. #$%
@#$ $#@ With a kickstarted game, the developers pay themselves a 'salary' as a development cost. #$%
@#$ $#@ If theyre honest and good they spend their money on food and rent. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were one of the first indie devs #$%
@#$ $#@ I am not talking about cutting and running or misusing funds. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is outside the scope of this discussion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im talking about giving yourself a salary so that you can continue working on your game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon asserted that devs shouldnt spend backer money on bills &amp; rent, and I disagree. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope the reasons are obvious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is $180,000 really how much it takes to feed a 4 man team over a year? #$%
@#$ $#@ but then they're not spending the money on the game #$%
@#$ $#@ Because as the gullible retards before you have stated they want the money because they cant actually afford to make the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem is that its most likely just a scam to get some months rent instead of actually getting the product you donated for. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was in college, then he got some job, then he made a kickstarter so he could quit job #$%
@#$ $#@ With viraling you can just keep rolling the dice until you get something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no buy in besides your time. #$%
@#$ $#@ He must have run out of money by now though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing as the $185,322 wasn't just his wage but a load of other shit plus I doubt he is good with money they must have shit all #$%
@#$ $#@ Boy I didnt realize there were so many indieshit shills trying to defend these scam artists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Must be because of that one guy from earlier in the thread getting revenge after being called out as an uncreative hack. #$%
@#$ $#@ $45000 a year isnt very good pay especially if they live somewhere expensive. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont mind me asking, what exactly is it ripping off? #$%
@#$ $#@ When they live in San Francisco and blow their money on parties with the rest of the friscan circlejerk it barely covers shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hear things like this regularly, yet here I am living on under 10k a year and feeling spoiled on my new desk chair. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking fun ass game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got every single borg. #$%
@#$ $#@ An actual game on steam? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant have that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, why are so many retards preordering Fallout 4? #$%
@#$ $#@ They think its gonna be good or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeap, it is quite expensive...unlike of this, on january 16th we will get a good jrpg dragon dogman arisen for 30 dollars only. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck do you have CSGO in your library? #$%
@#$ $#@ Monopoly money. #$%
@#$ $#@ CDN stands for can do nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off reddit #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself weeb. #$%
@#$ $#@ whos we? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pre-odering gets Symphonia free; you will be able to buy Symphonia separately, later, otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ VESPERIA ON PC! #$%
@#$ $#@ Normal people. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait shit i posted the wrong image #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill yourself, subhuman #$%
@#$ $#@ no, you kill yourself, subhuman. #$%
@#$ $#@ why would anyone do that when ToS on ps3 is like 10 bucks now #$%
@#$ $#@ Now this is proper bait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the same thing with undertale. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know why but as of late the games I dislike CANNOT exist mindset seems to have spread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up Danny DeVito #$%
@#$ $#@ Its been proven that this game is LITERAL shit #$%
@#$ $#@ git gud #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks fine to me, friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ s-sauce on that pic? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id much rather play CTHCC than a lot of shlock that is being passed on for games these days in the West. #$%
@#$ $#@ probably because of the BONUS #$%
@#$ $#@ I never liked Steam and loving is even farther away. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is an evil you cant get around unless you pirate everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ The more games the better though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Steam is unbrowsable for a long time now, why stop now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Where did this come from? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish it was tbh, chinks should build there own store for all the weeb shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese games are saving Steam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats new? #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit why? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this trigger you a Japanese game is now above your precious Fallout 4? #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, its shit, but at least this means future games will probably come to PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a bad japanese game, and a terrible, bare bones lazy port to boot. #$%
@#$ $#@ TitS didnt even get in tens of thousands of copies sold last I heard. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sure about that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it was #1 for at least a whole day. #$%
@#$ $#@ The steam userbase doesn't care about good games #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Steam userbase seems to buy a lot more likely from companies well known. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any game published by big company will usually get lot of sales. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeh I fucking hate the retards in /v/ who kept posting spoilers for Trails in the Sky because "You should had bought it on PSP!". #$%
@#$ $#@ Just fuck off already, fucktards seriously. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ended up never buying it as a result. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's probably better than it's done on NA PSN though #$%
@#$ $#@ Xillia 2 and Graces F for the gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything but Symphonias to be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you can wait for sales, a bundle of Xillia 1 and Graces F generally go on sale on PSN for like 15 dollars #$%
@#$ $#@ oh cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been eyeing this series for a long time but never got started with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was thinking of starting with Xillia anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ He may as well wait for Steam version while at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean Zestiria is selling so well I wouldnt be surprised if they ported the others games too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would love a Versperia PC port since it never got an english PS3 release and I don't have CFW or an xbox 360 #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a PC game, not a PSP game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because 30 FPS and hopes of some modding in 60 probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not everyone own a PS3 maybe. #$%
@#$ $#@ do even know the meaning of the word "ancient" faggot? #$%
@#$ $#@ PC users have this mentality that if they buy this maybe they'll get better games in the future #$%
@#$ $#@ Well it has worked many times before. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't mind seeing Digimon Cyber Sleuth come to PC, but then again I plan on getting the PS4 version anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ I much rather play on my PC than PS3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not emulating the GCN version which is 60 fps? #$%
@#$ $#@ The HD version / PS2 version barely adds anything worthwhile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its really sad besides CS:GO a Tales game has the most mechanical skill out of any other game on that list. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you buy the PS4 version when the PC version would be cheaper and with better visuals? #$%
@#$ $#@ And just plain comfy to begin with. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont get some people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you not know? #$%
@#$ $#@ you get a free copy of Tales of Symphonia if you pre order right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or let all the other goys preorder now and buy symphonia when it releases later #$%
@#$ $#@ Worse than Xillia 1? #$%
@#$ $#@ The one with the hard mode final boss fight that lasts an hour or more depending on RNG due to resurrection? #$%
@#$ $#@ You get 2 games for the price of one. #$%
@#$ $#@ And as a bonus you make redditors like OP get asshurt over the fact an anime game is selling well on Steam. #$%
@#$ $#@ How did they manage to make a game THAT bad #$%
@#$ $#@ It cant be worse than Fallout 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ FO4 will at least be fixed to a degree with mods but Zestiria is completely fucked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Punch self in face #$%
@#$ $#@ punch own face #$%
@#$ $#@ tell Simon that TTGL is shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Get some popcorn. #$%
@#$ $#@ ROBOTS THAT IS #$%
@#$ $#@ And so you took your squishy human self into the giant robotic fray #$%
@#$ $#@ RULES OF NATURE #$%
@#$ $#@ Dodge giant robot foot #$%

@#$ $#@ Punch back the robot foot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Punch back robot foot with freedom #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt seem to work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since you are a tiny human #$%
@#$ $#@ It works anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Climb up the robot leg and punch him in his robot nads. #$%
@#$ $#@ do it again, but with your super EMP glove #$%
@#$ $#@ Start rubbing the robot foot in an extremely weird and sensual manner #$%
@#$ $#@ Asuras wrath on that foot! #$%
@#$ $#@ Push it back with the fist of the northstar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Suddenly, the foot retracts #$%
@#$ $#@ Jump and punch it again to knock the robot off balance. #$%
@#$ $#@ "looks like the shoe....is on the other foot" #$%
@#$ $#@ Damnit, it's too high up #$%
@#$ $#@ put on your Jordans and try again #$%
@#$ $#@ No its not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Summon dragon zord #$%
@#$ $#@ Use magic science jet boots #$%
@#$ $#@ No its not. #$%
@#$ $#@ how about you sit on the bench like a bitch because you cant even jump while the real men play basketball #$%
@#$ $#@ what a fag #$%
@#$ $#@ you sit on the bench like a bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ Become more determined. #$%
@#$ $#@ Summon tyrannosaurus Rex zord #$%
@#$ $#@ But you're not a power ranger #$%
@#$ $#@ What would it take to get your life back on track? #$%
@#$ $#@ Become a transformer and take the form of a jet and fly up and punch there face #$%
@#$ $#@ "More than meets the eye" #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre almost as pathetic as Zebra. #$%
@#$ $#@ get in the giant robot #$%
@#$ $#@ what a pathetic faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Become a power ranger and get a zord #$%
@#$ $#@ suddenly, a giant robot from space #$%

@#$ $#@ Convince the right shit to come clean with his feelings for the left shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ good, make shitty robot #$%
@#$ $#@ It's too nervous #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask scrooge mcduck for a loan #$%
@#$ $#@ PUT THEM IN DESIGNATED SHITTING STREET #$%
@#$ $#@ Make the two shits have marital problems #$%
@#$ $#@ Encourage him #$%
@#$ $#@ And so they spent their honeymoon in India #$%
@#$ $#@ Check on the robot battle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jump back into the fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ I go to work, dont fuck this shit up. #$%
@#$ $#@ where are we on the giant robot battle? #$%
@#$ $#@ can we....hack one of their auxiliary robot defense fighters or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Everythign is on fire and Outtabudgetto Simon Custom is retreating #$%
@#$ $#@ Take a picture for your photo album. #$%
@#$ $#@ Welp thats it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Weve successfully created the single most pathetic MC to date. #$%
@#$ $#@ opine to the girl next to you: "yea he would, pussy ass bitch" #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow how did man with no game Im mean no name, do it? #$%
@#$ $#@ NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE GIANT ROBOT WAR ASSHOLE #$%
@#$ $#@ Break the camera. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cry some more while you wait for something interesting to happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Walk off into the sunset. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stare at your broken camera while reflecting on the events that led you to break your own camera. #$%

@#$ $#@ Run into plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ do a pirouette #$%
@#$ $#@ good thread everybody, peace #$%
@#$ $#@ Get sun burn and walk back from the sunset #$%
@#$ $#@ Have a break down as The Man With No Game drags you away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Run back #$%
@#$ $#@ you finally discovered that you're a homosexual #$%
@#$ $#@ [inaudible yelling] #$%
@#$ $#@ The next morning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go get pizza and share with no one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your tema had to restrain you. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOur kicking and screaming was way too annoying last night. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that the battle is done, whats are next objective? #$%
@#$ $#@ You've become so desperate you plot to steal one of your teams robots #$%
@#$ $#@ You hear the voice of God to tell you to stop being such a fuck up #$%
@#$ $#@ BUt, which robot should you steal, and how? #$%
@#$ $#@ Bane's, and with the power of plot progression #$%
@#$ $#@ provoke bane #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask him if he can breath with out his mask #$%
@#$ $#@ why dont we go in to the next DIY-Super-Robot Store and buy a kit? #$%
@#$ $#@ take off his mask #$%
@#$ $#@ "Yeah, but it'll be painful" #$%
@#$ $#@ The Man With No Game slaps you for attempting to steal a mech. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bet you can't do it #$%
@#$ $#@ "I'll take my mask off if you take off yours" #$%
@#$ $#@ "Please, you have nothing to bet with" #$%
@#$ $#@ My awesome scarf #$%
@#$ $#@ You wear a helmet though #$%
@#$ $#@ And I am very pretty, I might be a girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Free yourself from the rope and throw a ninja star at Bane's mask #$%
@#$ $#@ And so you went Circle M. #$%
@#$ $#@ God reminds you that you don't have any money #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy mostly everything in the bargain bin. #$%
@#$ $#@ "He's right my child, you ahve no cash" #$%
@#$ $#@ pull out your secret savings #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up god! #$%
@#$ $#@ luckly you are awarded for being the insert big number here customer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Turns out the store is having a super market sweep tv show that day and you get selected to participate #$%
@#$ $#@ "fuck off God" #$%
@#$ $#@ "Ah, congrats honorable customer-san, for beeing the 9911th customer, you get a discount!" #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you god #$%
@#$ $#@ let's go shopping #$%
@#$ $#@ trade your discount for the kinda shiny giant robot. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't have any money, kidnap the nearest girl and hold her for ransom #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a super Mario robot, jumping won't be a problem #$%
@#$ $#@ "Are you sure sir?" #$%
@#$ $#@ what other options do we have? #$%
@#$ $#@ No ask for the super Mario robot #$%
@#$ $#@ does it have cup holders? #$%
@#$ $#@ hmmmmmmmm, Sure? #$%
@#$ $#@ Change your mind and go for the girl robot with a new hat #$%
@#$ $#@ "Yes, with a built in coffe machine" #$%
@#$ $#@ dont you asians like tea? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that what else you got #$%
@#$ $#@ "Yes, but the tea dispenser is kinda mandatory for all robots already so the coffe machine is the new thing" #$%
@#$ $#@ Whelp, looks good to me #$%
@#$ $#@ can you add a freedom paintjob? #$%
@#$ $#@ I see past your ruse chinaman, everyone knows that the only way to make tea is with a ceremony! #$%
@#$ $#@ "Then sign here please" #$%
@#$ $#@ Scribbles and some loops. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't sign #$%
@#$ $#@ read the contract carefully #$%
@#$ $#@ Man you can't read chinese #$%
@#$ $#@ Ask for interpreter #$%
@#$ $#@ Wonder why there's Chinese text in a japanese shop #$%
@#$ $#@ "Ooh me, i can speak moon" #$%
@#$ $#@ Laura actually looks good #$%
@#$ $#@ Laura is a good guy, though #$%
@#$ $#@ HAIR IS FUCKING HARD okay? #$%
@#$ $#@ these tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a ridiculous amount of clipping though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, how did they think that was okay? #$%
@#$ $#@ not when it's that static #$%
@#$ $#@ can't stand the tumblr haircut #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, what does her being black or not black have to do with anything? #$%
@#$ $#@ man fucking hate that hair...like its not even bad or anything but the fucking indecisiveness of that fucking hairdo just fucking gets to me #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Laura good for beginners? #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like just a harmless suggestion, of course if you want i guess it could be sexual. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt expect many artists to latch onto the idea though. #$%
@#$ $#@ not much #$%
@#$ $#@ No stop being thirsty for Juri faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ It is a harmless suggestion, but knowing that Mel could potentially be with Laura at some point is all it takes to ignite an artists mind. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish I knew how to draw... #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe as DLC but I doubt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well it doesnt have to just be Laura, since jui jitsu schools can be taught by just about anyone proficient in the style. #$%
@#$ $#@ She probably isnt even the originator, was probably her dad or grandpa. #$%
@#$ $#@ Matsuda Jiu Jitsu seem to be a reference to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, in any case the Matsuda family must be a direct reference to the Gracie family, which is odd because Oro was apparently based on Helio Gracie, and I dont think Laura is in any way related to Oro. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a website I can go to to get that wrapping paper? #$%
@#$ $#@ dat ass #$%
@#$ $#@ It seems like Laura was modelled by someone other than the usual modeller. #$%
@#$ $#@ Compare her hair to Necallis noclip chair. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Laura modeller makes better looking models but fails on the tech side. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its hard for me to believe that the same person worked on Laura and Ken. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ken is a hideous disgusting pile of walking shame. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that we have models like that in this day in age is absolutely sickening and disappoints all of humanity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ken's hair also clips though, and so does Karin's hair. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alex is strongly suggested to come as launch DLC though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody cares about DLC. #$%
@#$ $#@ The starting roster is all that matters and speaks volumes about Capcoms priorities. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant see how it doesnt matter, unless they ban him from tournaments or something, Capcom doesnt have any priorities. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the starting roster is the most important. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yes they do. #$%
@#$ $#@ No they dont, they know they can release any character through DLC and people will buy it anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think youre missing the point of this game entirely, the starting roster is not supposed to be the definitive version of the game, it was already said too many times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not her intro line, I think she says that when you win with her Ultra. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was watching some gameplay at NYCC. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never said it was the only characters we'd get, just that they're considered the most important. #$%
@#$ $#@ The starting roster are the ones Capcom thinks will generate the most sales. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her japanese intro is something like "it starts with a beat and ends with a bang", I wonder if it was a translation error. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does the bottom girl have a teeny tiny mustache? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant wait to see them 20 years from now when they shrink and become fat like all Hispanic women. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone playing the game seriously cares #$%
@#$ $#@ How are people supposed to know? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's obviously original but there's no way to know if it's in the game or if it was made only for the trailer, maybe it's her theme or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her voice is terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was okay in the trailer, didnt mind it in the intro. #$%
@#$ $#@ But after watching some gameplay videos, her voice is pretty bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Needs to be more sensual like Brazilian girls have. #$%
@#$ $#@ But then again shes raised by Japs or something, so it still makes sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ nice headphones, got the same ones #$%
@#$ $#@ He just wears sandnigger clothes and then has a backpack to summon wind. #$%
@#$ $#@ The scouter is the only thing weird about his design, but its about as busy of an addition as Alexs eye scar or Nashs stitches/glasses. #$%
@#$ $#@ lmao it has to be opposite day #$%
@#$ $#@ the lost kardashian? #$%
@#$ $#@ So much porn soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Juri was hot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better to be gay than have shit taste #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, you're not, it just happens that people who don't like things are vocal about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its pretty cool, they just need to fix the clipping. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not necessarily hot though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both sides seem equally vocal in this case #$%
@#$ $#@ No but they're both hot #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Juri good for a beginner?? #$%
@#$ $#@ In 20 years there will be new hot spic bitches. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree with everything but looking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brazilian and Japanese like Sean. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is a brazilian supposed to look? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well theyd still be factually better in almost every other way, aside from the personal preference of looks. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could do worse i guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reverse search gives me nothing, who is that and is there more? #$%
@#$ $#@ Search the word "panicat panico" #$%
@#$ $#@ Meevers Desu, cosplayer. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is kinda average. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her facebook is /MeeversCosplay #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes alright, I was expecting her to be brazilian so it kind of ruined for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't understand your post, are you asking or are you saying that's going to happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ Good that they made them prettier than in 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks better when its more like braids instead of cornrows. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are Cammys nipples erect? #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me one I actually can see her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to give her a quick edit to see how she looks with different hair. #$%
@#$ $#@ truly we live in the waifu age #$%
@#$ $#@ Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like? #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn it stop posting this shitty picture #$%
@#$ $#@ top kek, didn't even realize that #$%
@#$ $#@ Cammy a best #$%
@#$ $#@ So your taste got exponentially worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ lady-boys are trannies hueman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Capcom really knows its customers. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ In the busted and worthless waifu bin with Sakura, Ibuki, C Viper, Juri, Elena, and Poison. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better hope they get preferential DLC treatment. #$%
@#$ $#@ HER HAIR MAKES ME IRRATIONALLY ANGRY FUCKING CAPCOM #$%
@#$ $#@ could you link this video pls? #$%
@#$ $#@ i need to see more Laura gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ the starting roster is what sells the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also don't expect too many dlc characters, expect much more cosmetic dlc and other shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I know Im way late for this but I havent been on /v/ since Rashid was revealed and i just wanna say FUCK ALL YOU WHO SAID GIEF WASNT GONNA BE IN. #$%
@#$ $#@ as an added bonus he looks even stronger than he was in 4 with all those armor moves. #$%
@#$ $#@ russian wrestling is always #1 you fucking bitches i said he was gonna be in and you all told me he wasnt i was right you were wrong fucking kill yourselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ There were people who doubted Zangief would be in? #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant have a SF game without Gief in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean i guess you technically can but its a sure sign it will be shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I expected a different looking Gief. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the SF2 characters that matter are in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ They removed his green hand, like what the hell why would you remove such an iconic move? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ironically SnakeEyez says he's evaluating if he'll main Geif in V because he looks dumb mechanically. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think Snake is gonna have someone in SFV that'll be an exact match for how he plays Zangief in Ultra. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Birdie, but I say that just because of his really good normals. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are still more coming as DLC and you cant stop them.Guile is way too popular, probably the remaining shadaloo bosses Sagat and Balrog are coming back too maybe more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say Blanka has a 100% chance of coming back at some point because Ono will try to shove he in in every opportunity he gets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cammy and Mika must do the same like Laura. #$%
@#$ $#@ when the fuck are they gonna fix Ken's face #$%
@#$ $#@ Cammy and Mika already show their asses in close ups in lots of different animations tho #$%
@#$ $#@ $4.99 Classic Ken DLC Pack #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre dumber than a nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ For a little while there, as hope increased so did despair. #$%
@#$ $#@ This upsets me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such annoying levels of clipping, even Mika's boobs clip, it's like Capcom is putting zero effort in the animations. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game will look amazing on p.c. #$%
@#$ $#@ With that amount of clipping it wont look amazing anywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4 had a ridiculous amount of clipping too so Im surprised that people are surprised about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It certainly did, but in V it's obviously out of hand, I mean fucking look at Laura's hair, just look at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, id fuck laura, never stick your dick in crazy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats stopping you? #$%
@#$ $#@ just go in knowing that its a score attack game. #$%
@#$ $#@ first time through, youre just learning the courses. #$%
@#$ $#@ its when you go back for higher scores that it gets its hooks in you. #$%
@#$ $#@ but if you're not into score attacks then it's hard to recommend. #$%
@#$ $#@ I literally only know what shantae is because of all the autists voting for her in the ballot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will personally the most upset if a character I had never even heard of from a game I had never heard of, makes it in over characters from past smash games, or more relevant games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The one I'd like the least is shovel knight because everyone else has at least been a nintendo character for over a decade now #$%
@#$ $#@ Shovel Knight. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's more popular than Shantae and people would certainly react to a new indie character making it in before other Nintendo characters #$%
@#$ $#@ Took a break from playing videogames to post in an autistic ballot thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you excited for the next marketing scheme for Hakurai to nickel and dime you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Next Direct after Sakurai is done deleting every ballot entry and replacing them with Dark Rosalina. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id be alright with an inkling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try Psychonauts #$%
@#$ $#@ checking that out now, will let you know #$%
@#$ $#@ It constantly teases one every level, but finds a way to avoid it. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a last boss, though, which is kind of cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats the only one. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this game after sf3 or what nigger? #$%
@#$ $#@ Before, but it's very likely it'll go right into it in a future update. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyve confirmed it takes place before 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ That would imply Mk had a good story to began with #$%
@#$ $#@ do you have the charlie one that just came out? #$%
@#$ $#@ UDON is glorified fanfiction. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something more official would be nice to have. #$%
@#$ $#@ Besides, SP content is always good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't own it but I just read it a few hours ago at a buddies house #$%
@#$ $#@ any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ They aren't as bombastic as MK though #$%
@#$ $#@ what other fighter has actually copied it? #$%
@#$ $#@ BB has "expansive VN" story mode, and GG had a pretty elaborate story mode set up in AC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus SNK has been doing good story fighters for decades. #$%
@#$ $#@ Search it on moe /co/ #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont really give a fuck since I play fighters for their gameplay and not for their story #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes just speaking out his ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ignore him #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wouldn't mind that because while not the best source material or game, the framing of the story mode in MK9 and 10 is it's strong suit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the dumb fans can't live without their Guile/other SF2 character #$%
@#$ $#@ SF2 is holding back SF. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was talking about SF. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only interesting character is Sagat really, and only because of his redemption storyline. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it's after 3 then why aren't there many characters from 3? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why couldnt SF2 characters be around after SF3? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you even know how to read bro? #$%
@#$ $#@ Learn to read you braindead idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ My bad, I meant when are they gonna add characters from 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ What a waste of resources. #$%
@#$ $#@ What waste? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like they're making a whole new game like Tekken or even SC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just going to be arcade mode but with animated cutscenes and more dialogue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just for nin crossover Ryu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga has in in TvC, SFxT, UMvC and Smash. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course when I fuck up people are quick to respond but when I fix it, nothing #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just going to be some unique opening shit in an arcade style mode with maybe some text boxes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like what? #$%
@#$ $#@ This cast simply doesnt let them do much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of them have intriguing backstories, like Ryu, Vega, Bison, Vega, and Cammy but I'm not expecting much #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't expect it to be nothing other than shit, but that's not why I'm buying the game so it doesn't matter to me anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not everyone that plays fighting games are hardcore tourneyfags, you know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet you the cut scenes are just shitty anime still pics like tekken epilogues #$%
@#$ $#@ KoF characters stopped aging after 95 #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every fighting game has a terrible story. #$%
@#$ $#@ sfiii is pretty much a deleted timeline already, they only salvaged the characters #$%
@#$ $#@ casuals do #$%
@#$ $#@ people that dont play fighting games care and they are the majority of the sales #$%
@#$ $#@ SFV is setting up SF3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just look at Charlie #$%
@#$ $#@ EVE isn't a game it's real life. #$%
@#$ $#@ But you only pay for EVE if you're bad #$%
@#$ $#@ And if youre good, you only pay for EVE with your self-respect and free time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love this meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats a better use of time? #$%
@#$ $#@ What if people enjoy having a job in a world they can actually progress in? #$%
@#$ $#@ quality content fam #$%
@#$ $#@ I shouldnt have tried to have a civilized dialogue with an MMO-junkie in the first place. #$%
@#$ $#@ You keep using the word MMO like EVE relates to any other game from this genre. #$%
@#$ $#@ That itself is offensive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt being ironic you fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because thats what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you think that EVE is some unique snowflake among MMOs youre delusional. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stress &amp; release if how good games work. #$%
@#$ $#@ In real life you can have fun at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just noticed the sniper has no scope #$%
@#$ $#@ but Im not hearing buzz about it here #$%
@#$ $#@ How deep/challenging does the combat get? #$%
@#$ $#@ its mashy with being able to use some skills. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not very deep and challenging #$%
@#$ $#@ Hows the story and endings? #$%
@#$ $#@ Since when Gust have two teams? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it feel like Musou game? #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks fun as fuck if thats anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jiggly enough to get an erection. #$%
@#$ $#@ What more could you want? #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ is full of casuals that dont know japanese, when senran kagura was japan only the threads didnt last 10 posts #$%
@#$ $#@ so its like SMT with lesbians? #$%
@#$ $#@ If youre thinking of the Raidou game then yeah its Raidou with lesbian and better gameplay not hard to do Ill give you that. #$%
@#$ $#@ MAKOTO THE BLOODEDGE WHEN?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Taokaka is a cat. #$%
@#$ $#@ And shes happy as long as she has someone to mooch off of. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nus happiness is entirely contingent on the Ragnabowl. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has nothing else, which is why she deserves it. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one deserves to win the Ragnabowl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ragna is too good for the pile of crap that is the female cast. #$%
@#$ $#@ He deserves to die peacefully sacrificing himself to save the world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ragna should sacrifice himself for Nus happiness instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ dank meme #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels good #$%
@#$ $#@ when will you give up #$%
@#$ $#@ Never underestimate the dedication of waifufags. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, please let her win #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess its time to stop #$%
@#$ $#@ A sister? #$%
@#$ $#@ Guilty Gear came back #$%
@#$ $#@ lol no #$%
@#$ $#@ BlazBlue is a trash-tier anime fighter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres not much else to discuss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Captain Bullet will come back in a CF gag reel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no new information on Central Fiction so cant talk about that and everyone that actually plays the game got busy with college. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was the September loketest the last one for CF? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its supposed to release this winter, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels like we know so little about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you the /vg/ police or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never paid attention to the arcade releases, but did ASW ever release a new subtitled installment with only two new characters? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure we still have loketests left #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt know that but fair enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although subtitles mean different things between GG and BB. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was Slash another main installment or an updated version of XX? #$%
@#$ $#@ Update, AC was the next main installment. #$%
@#$ $#@ im so glad to know that im not the only guy who thinks nu is best girl and deserves to win #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Makoto fuck Ragna? #$%
@#$ $#@ I ship this crack pairing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please give source. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant play yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get my game on Tuesday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tao is the only one worthy of winning the ragnabowl #$%
@#$ $#@ Well fuck, I dont want to live vicariously through that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hits too close to home. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how Tanabes pixiv is filled with comments, in English, from people asking where they can buy the Bullet doujin. #$%
@#$ $#@ She didnt get any new tools. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shell stomp pubs since shes footsie character and they all love to push buttons online, but she does not have the oppressive setplay and pressure tools built into her kit like relius, nu, valk, etc have. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is literally no way she could ever be top tier u less her reversal got huge buffs and could convert to big dmg off no heat. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is the only buff that could make her top tier and it would be dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Starting match at heat 2 would also give potential for top tier as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ She now has no heat loss on blocked drives, a gigantic 5D range increase, and a 360 command throw. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's not Lambda #$%
@#$ $#@ Rachel isnt Homura/Okabe/Rika. #$%
@#$ $#@ She hasn't been "trying to save everyone" and she hasn't been "suffering." #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes mostly just been bored in the audience and occasionally heckling the actors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes trying to do stuff now sure, but trying to paint the eons she spent drinking tea, eating scones, and mocking Ragna as ennobling self-sacrifice is just plain wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ She literallly has this in the bag #$%
@#$ $#@ If she does appear in CF then likely youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would, but Ive got dialysis at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want everyone to win the Alphabowl. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want a Glasses of Eros Mk. #$%
@#$ $#@ III with Alpha and a neverending tide of bisexual rape and gangbang doujins. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know why but lately I have been shipping Nu and Lambda together, is that bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is this QT booty? #$%
@#$ $#@ Noel Vermilion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just another devout believer in our lewd goddess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go get er, Rags. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can dig that. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's multiple loktests and seeing as how this is a pretty big release I'm expecting it to go for another several weeks at the very least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Execution when? #$%
@#$ $#@ I forget, is ASW being as stingy with their GG news? #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope that Mai will appear in CF. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nu is going to get saved so fucking hard, look at that face! #$%
@#$ $#@ She doesnt even know what is about to happen! #$%
@#$ $#@ Mai is also in love with a guy that isnt Ragna. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, her too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although even then I liked seeing her swoon over Ragna. #$%
@#$ $#@ When was this? #$%
@#$ $#@ CS bad end? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you often get called obnoxious or obsessive by the people around you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hakumen if you want all fundamentals and less of the combo stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think that Mai swooned over Ragna. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was impressed by his fighting skill and thankful to him for helping her, but she didnt actually show any romantic interest in him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing as how the game is releasing within one to two months, never because ASW hates you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish they liked us. #$%
@#$ $#@ /r/ing that Korean drawfags comic with little Nu and Lambda talking about killing because I foolishly believed the archive would last. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got you #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ragna is still one unlucky bitch, but Id love to be in his shoes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Watch Lambda end up killing Nu in CF. #$%
@#$ $#@ if all else fails, we got a backup plan! #$%
@#$ $#@ Alpha is a bad idea but she makes my dick hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything that makes your dick hard, can't be a bad Idea #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Alphas a fantastic idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres foreshadowing for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its been years in the making. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a reasonable inversion of the Black Beast being a Blazblue body and a Murakumo heart, where it'd be Ragna's heart in Nu's body. #$%
@#$ $#@ It gives the two most utterly doomed characters a satisfying happy ending from one another. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also means I can openly lust for Ragna without being a flaming homo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thus, fantastic idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, itd be so perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can only hope Mori has the sense to do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but he might make another one, although it might be in another harem one like Ragna-Lock. #$%
@#$ $#@ INFERNO DIVIDAH #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe itll happen when CF finally has both characters interacting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or at least existing at the same time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at those eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll never direct a gaze like that at you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good, Ragna deserves it. #$%
@#$ $#@ as it should be #$%
@#$ $#@ Kagura pls leave #$%
@#$ $#@ Kagura should content himself with his cheap floozies. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Hibiki. #$%
@#$ $#@ puppet user #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she knows how much of a shit Kagura is and how Noel should end up with Ragna instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ yep, swords are getting faster, she is getting some follow ups to blade, for some actual mix up, specials seem a lot better for lockdown, its going to be good to main lambda in CF #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes also getting the pew pew laser sound effects, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Clearly the most important buff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I watched the loketests, but I didn't hear it on Lambdas swords, It might be Nu exclusive or they just haven't changed the sound yet, hopefully she also gets the PEW PEW! #$%
@#$ $#@ Indeed, and itll happen eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe when a longer holiday comes around. #$%
@#$ $#@ These threads have been pretty shit since when they became daily back in August. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it before when it was maybe once every month or two and we could actually talk about the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Girl winning and establishing a relationship in a ongoing japanese franchise, In a fighting game no less. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come one if characters werent canonically in a relationship before the story started it wont happen in any of the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never got into Blazeblu so is it actually just harem shit in fighting game form? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, thats mainly just fan stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Blazblue is an extremely long, batshit insane and convoluted sci-fi action story that has basically every animu cliche in the book. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only 2 girls are in love with the protagonist. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a whole lot more, but it IS technically two since most of them are clones of one another #$%
@#$ $#@ Noel doesnt feel romantic love with Ragna. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only Celica and Rachel do. #$%
@#$ $#@ BLACK HAWK #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, but she has not come back to life again yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ go to sleep bonehead #$%
@#$ $#@ Mentally challenged burn victim? #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean horribly scarred? #$%
@#$ $#@ Intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor #$%
@#$ $#@ A rapist? #$%
@#$ $#@ How small is small? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because u can't hit their head due to your shit aim, doesn't mean everyone else sucks, and its left to a coin flip. #$%
@#$ $#@ It plays nothing like Battlefied, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish that they had copied Battlefield at this point #$%
@#$ $#@ Except its not in space. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like if an author released a preview chapter of his book and people said that there wasn't enough content in twenty pages to warrant a purchase of the whole thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its missing tons of shit the last game had, no excuses, shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ explain whats fun about it #$%
@#$ $#@ it has the lifespan of a fruit fly #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen rebels win about 3 times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fun as fuck when you get into it and its a close battle, I thing this game does objective based maps very very well. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's why he said 'appears', since we can see a list of levels in the game but can't play them #$%
@#$ $#@ There are tokens on the battlefield. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some give weapons like shields, some give vehicles that they clearly indicate like an X-wing or AT-ST, some let you play as Vader or Luke. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would not pay more than 15-20 USD for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its alright but not full retail alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop lying. #$%
@#$ $#@ They spawn for your entire team first come first serve nothing to do with killstreaks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre literally not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once a pick up spawns anyone can take it. #$%
@#$ $#@ They even spawn at set locations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I get a sauce on those spicy opinions? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes lying m8. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre pick ups, anyone can take them. #$%
@#$ $#@ its more like you are eating the burger without the bun and condiments. #$%
@#$ $#@ those do change the overall flavor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because that other guy called you out on being a retard for judging the replay value of a game based on a small fraction of its total content, and then you went on your autistic tirade about how more maps wont change the flavour of the burger. #$%
@#$ $#@ titanfall is not star wars #$%
@#$ $#@ but if you are missing guns, maps, and modes youa re missing out on some flavor. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't want arma 2 in space I wanted fucking Battlefront 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey bro, dont you be dissin on my boy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont the power ups fix the problem of people camping vehicle spawn sites? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was the result of you fucking goy-boys getting cucked by Leltronic Farts #$%
@#$ $#@ maps if they have special events could to an extent as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ i will admit modes was just grasping at straws. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty sure the battlefield community is used to getting shit on by now #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem is the random ship drops. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the ships were stationed like in battlefield then you could send the person who is best with the vehicles to grab them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty good shooting down tie fighters, but rarely find a drop. #$%
@#$ $#@ Meanwhile I seen dumbfucks crashing 20 feet in front of the at-ats or trying to shoot enemy players instead of using the cable to trip them when they have the chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ barney should have never been banned. #$%
@#$ $#@ The vehicles always show up in the same locations I think there's 3 for each phase #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell no titanfall wasnt near as fun #$%
@#$ $#@ been playing few rounds and every perk is located in the same place. #$%
@#$ $#@ its kinda stupid since they could have had the vehicales just physically be there because its pretty much the same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder to stop being the cancer #$%
@#$ $#@ If you get competent X/A-wing pilots, AT-STs dont have a chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Problem is that most people are shit and go for infantry right away and either crash or get shot down within seconds. #$%
@#$ $#@ the thing that i notice is that you get x wings that are much better than tie fighters overall. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you take control of the air, you can kill the at st like nothing, but thats only if your playing with a smart team. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty much ya but since its old and made from another compay, they probably thought that making something new would be better but its utter dogshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its an extrapolation of both quality and replayability, both of which can be assessed in the beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what extrapolation is all about, taking a limited sample and scaling it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ flying is easy man once you know how to play them, also the perks really need to be placed better in the map cuz holy shit you literally have to be in the middle of the fire fight to get a x wing for the rebels unlike the empire. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would think your just an idiot but it has been proven that EA has posted here before when Battlefield 3 was coming out. #$%
@#$ $#@ sad but true the only reason im going to play this dogshit game because its a modern star wars game and its somewhat fun if your team actually use the fucking chat box and talk to each other. #$%
@#$ $#@ dude EAs beta always end up being the true game in the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ They literally have one month left to fix small bugs and nothing else. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was just the beta m8. #$%
@#$ $#@ There just isnt enough in the beta to convince me to preorder or even buy the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like the BF4 beta with the super cool city map, both maps are pretty bland and there really just isn't enough shit to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not even a beta, it's more like a showcase/demo that you can finish in 1 hour.. #$%
@#$ $#@ walker assault look a bit limited compared to an open battlefield map. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could make an entire game with only siege of shanghai and sell it for 20 bucks but with battlefront walker assault is very limited. #$%
@#$ $#@ Launch has 12 maps not 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Run and gun game play where death have no consequence. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guns have no recoil and feel light and underwhelming. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be a BLESSING if this was more like battlefield. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is not a fucking beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ A beta would have everything unlocked for you to test and send feedback. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a fucking demo. #$%
@#$ $#@ bf4 in particular is shit with horrendous hitreg. #$%
@#$ $#@ i was expecting the usual bf4 shitfest where you die instantly in a diarrhea of bullets but to my surprise the characters are quite spongy like bf3. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only way to win is to not vote. #$%
@#$ $#@ bump because Im really indecisive #$%
@#$ $#@ ya if there was much more varations of weapons like a sniper,light machine gun, shutgun etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ it would feel much better since people would try to switch it up in order to kill certain things or change the pace of the game #$%
@#$ $#@ What use is content when the game plays like shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally you. #$%
@#$ $#@ i have both a pc and ps4 and i would get it for the pc since i can play at 1440p or low spec 4k. #$%
@#$ $#@ you have to think about which will have more people to play with and i would assume ps4 since most likely normies are going to buy it since its very casual like cod. #$%
@#$ $#@ I find it kind of sad that xbox one still cant demanding games at 1080p or even something close. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean we had full hd games in the previous console generation as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish that consoles stopped pretending that they are not pcs and just gave proper graphics options for users so that they could choose what they wanted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Click on your icon on the top left of the menu screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can see some of your personal stats and those of your friends that are online. #$%
@#$ $#@ first person is for suckas #$%
@#$ $#@ Considered all the guns are practically hitscan 3rd person for peek advantage. #$%
@#$ $#@ i know that some cod games are better but im just saying that its very casual like this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ But ya cod is better in gameplay wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they have more comprehensive stats. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to see accuracy per weapon, grenade stats, vehicle stats and all the other shit I get in Battlefield. #$%
@#$ $#@ pc, cant even imagine playing this in ps4 let alone xbone. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy fuck this, people were like nah man its a beta, fuck that shit game was literally the beta with all the problems. #$%
@#$ $#@ I stopped playing battlefield after bad company 2 because of that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty fun but nothing like the originals. #$%
@#$ $#@ The sound design is fantastic though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just another FPS with a star wars theme on top. #$%
@#$ $#@ i can agree wth you on this, its really casual to much even that the major of people are just going to go for a better shooter like black ops 3 or whatever comes along after they get bored of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell splatoons community will out live this one even when the game is dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lad its a demo. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it really was a beta we would indeed have access to every map, in a beta you don't lock people out of shit because they have to pay for, you lock people out of it because it's not finished. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just face it, this is just a showcase. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing they changed from the beta in BF3 was that they made the medic a black man. #$%
@#$ $#@ every game that comes out now includes a black man or a female no matter what. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres glitches everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ i win more with rebels and i still say the game lacks to much for it to justify 60 bucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know but the token black man in BF3 was obvious as hell because he started out as a white man and they changed him black for no reason at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would not be as obvious nor funny if he was black from release. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can change it to 70% chance to kill someone if you want to pretend to be above average but the core idea is the same - the gameplay is repetitive. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is a shill #$%
@#$ $#@ do people actually think like this? #$%
@#$ $#@ found the guy that goes 3-47 in every game #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck me man. #$%
@#$ $#@ why would you want varied classes and a differentiation of equipment and playstyles when you can just have literally everyone in the server using lmgs, jetpacks, and sniper rifles? #$%
@#$ $#@ plz answer me lads #$%
@#$ $#@ Given the amount of players its easy for at least one of them to save an Orbital Strike. #$%
@#$ $#@ Drops AT-ATs down to like 25% health from 100%. #$%
@#$ $#@ well on hoth it doesn't matter because you get spawn killed instantly #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, can i play as a fucking squid monster? #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like a clusterfuck #$%
@#$ $#@ probably because that was really early into development, they didn't even have all the textures in place #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre going with the play it safe route. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jokes on you pal, everything is technically in space. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, all the planets and what not. #$%
@#$ $#@ don't forget the shield, and it totally didn't need to be nerf to have longer cooldown and less duration period. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you just suck or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ I got a good win ratio for both teams. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, at least the Asian Marksman is back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does the game gain anything from episode vii besides a map? #$%
@#$ $#@ seems like a complete waste to ditch the prequels which had by far the best setting for these games and fun as fuck 3rd faction to play as, for 1/3 a new trilogy especially if they dont have any new vehicles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very well written, especially the last part on how Hoth plays out the same, but maybe the problem lies in Walker Assult tho #$%
@#$ $#@ its a mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ like the cops and robbers mod they tried to charge money for. #$%
@#$ $#@ after the cycler rifle nerf #$%
@#$ $#@ the beta ends tomorrow #$%
@#$ $#@ oh fuck like theyre shutting the whole thing off or just closing downloads? #$%
@#$ $#@ Body shot cycle rifle users should be round up and gassed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like you wont be able to play the game again until launch. #$%
@#$ $#@ alright thanks dude guess ill just watch fucking youtube videos or something #$%
@#$ $#@ battlefront 2 felt awkward as fuck nigga what're you talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I the only one who thinks the auto aim function is too op? #$%
@#$ $#@ it was awkward but it was nowhere near as clunky as this game is #$%
@#$ $#@ The amount of fairfight kicks are incredible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the idiocy of rebels using orbitals on infantry instead of AT-ATs #$%
@#$ $#@ My buddy and I had to quit a few games before we were on the same team. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure but it is a game, there are orbital strikes and star destroyers in the bg. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dropped Titanfall's beta really quickly while I played this beta for quite a bit so I'd have to disagree #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, you are just used to hitscan guns and cant change the way you play. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont blame the game for your inability to adapt. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to lead targets because all projectiles in this game have a travel time #$%
@#$ $#@ So much this, people are so quick to judge without really trying to understand how to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably the most accurate analysis of this game in this whole thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, I feel like Im playing a single player game. #$%
@#$ $#@ J.Frog was my nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ My nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Speaking of, are there any browser-based games worth a damn? #$%
@#$ $#@ Beat this with a friend once. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit was great. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love the chalice too, it encourages sticking together and cooperation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Managing it was easy as someone would always grab it without needing to be told. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also that undead dragon boss is a bitch in multiplayer because you gotta cast holy and it requires teamwork and timing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember #$%
@#$ $#@ I vaguely remember the name Sandy, but I didnt play that often. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember someone convinced me to buy Counter Strike: Source on that server. #$%
@#$ $#@ I beat it every year with my friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ She plays selkie I play clavat #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope Explorers will be better #$%
@#$ $#@ It still hurts #$%
@#$ $#@ Only wish it came to the wiiu too, like echoes of time for wii #$%
@#$ $#@ That game in single player is impossible to beat #$%
@#$ $#@ This the game-play was something else m8 was amazing having a full rounded party smacking a minotaur #$%
@#$ $#@ Still have my disk,last I hear private servers were still up &amp; running? #$%
@#$ $#@ Please respond. #$%
@#$ $#@ A super egotistical game dev who makes shitty games and claims they are the best thing ever, then goes around hating on everyone else #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm about to make a room, if it it doesn't have the nice room theme I'm going to go fucking apeshit #$%
@#$ $#@ How does that setup even work? #$%
@#$ $#@ The only real answer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Needs more content, clearing it for the 500th time gets old. #$%
@#$ $#@ it does have the room theme, and the music from the maps as well #$%
@#$ $#@ Huh Ive seen a few treads here &amp; there? #$%
@#$ $#@ J-J-Frog Master race #$%
@#$ $#@ Boss mode because apparently you have to clear it before you can make anything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shit was great too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Victims of the same abusive father. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm butting into this conversation, but there's a difference in the way guns handle to the way they are presented in game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly after about 100 or so hours on KF2 I can safely say that the actual sound effects just arent that great compared to KF1. #$%
@#$ $#@ The majority just lack that extra oomph in audio compared to the original counterparts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus you cant deny that right now the majority of weapons just suck, like Demolitions is completely useless and the Medic once again gets poor selection. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I will admit is great are the weapon models and animations, especially during ZED time moments. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just fuck off already anti-shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're just mad that Killing Floor isn't your sekrit club game anymore you selfish fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I share you pain brothers, heres to one of the best MP experience from any game, ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ room is called /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ God Dystopia was some top tier shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The 2 smaller tvs will act as the GBA screen for item management. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then hook the GBA players into the wii just like you would hook up the gba to the gc/wii, and we can use GC controllers like you can in single player to play the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a video of some guys doing this for 4 player Four Swords Adventure, Ill try to find it. #$%
@#$ $#@ WHAT WORLD NIGGA #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wish someone remade this like how all the other mods got remade #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, thats cool as shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Gunbound was the shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I used to beat people with the worst car in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss this fucking game so much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Room is up #$%
@#$ $#@ room #104 pass is Penis #$%
@#$ $#@ I was playing this earlier, had a full sever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, I wasted time downloading the softnyx launcher #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time I checked, it was level capped to lvl 20 or so and only had like 400 people playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it even worth playing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fairly active nearly all the time and there are steady, consistent updates, so might as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kingdom of Loathings alright, or was last I played. #$%
@#$ $#@ This actually was probably the best game to ever come to consoles #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel your pain brother #$%
@#$ $#@ It fucking kills me that they won't rerelease this game on Wii U or 3DS #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I got to play that, I've dicked around slightly with bots but it's nowhere near the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot my pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Despite the obvious tits, the game didnt revolve around them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most mechs were legit mechs, like Macross and Gundam tier shit with some more crazy designs like fucking centaurs and one that was like a robotic brain with jets. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, didn't notice until I'd posted it. #$%
@#$ $#@ what a shame. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt meant to quote, my bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sate was my daily driver. #$%
@#$ $#@ pile of garbage, first one was better. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a waste of a fucking IP for a moba. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to Reddit.com™ faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am glad someone else on /v/ recognizes this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Loved using the sniper rifle while jetpacking out of harms way CTF. #$%
@#$ $#@ God I hope Shroud of the Avatar isnt another bomb. #$%
@#$ $#@ The truth fucking hurts. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would have bought an Xbox LIVE subscription just for this if they had kept it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best thing Microsoft ever did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I play Wayfar 1444. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its basically Star Wars Galaxies but with more focus on making colonies. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can even walk around in your space ship while its flying and have people aboard just like in SWG. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its in its early stages so the population is a little low. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game was fun as hell with a couple of friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember laughing so much when we found out you can clap harder by mashing the A button so thats all we did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres actually a Crystal Chronicles game for the DS, its not the same game but its the same mechanics and everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make your own character, collect armor and weapons etc etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its multiplayer too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does NCsoft hate fun? #$%
@#$ $#@ They are the most cancel happy company I know of. #$%
@#$ $#@ The games werent even doing that poorly. #$%
@#$ $#@ CoH was still bringing in a profit and I know Exteel was actually rising in popularity when it got canned. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that company. #$%
@#$ $#@ the think I dislike about the game is all the dyke pandering characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, you dont have to play them but some tumblr whore is going to play as the progressive dyke and you have to see that player model. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do western devs always pander to that, why cant there be a game without any pandering to a certain demographic. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want games to be games again.. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah I forgot to mention, the crystal chronicles for the DS has a stage that revisits the first crab boss stage from the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ Active Worlds #$%
@#$ $#@ you enjoyed it while it lasted and will forever have happy memories from the experience, isnt that kind of the point of life? #$%
@#$ $#@ minumum cuck wage #$%
@#$ $#@ Every box has a code printed on it, you text it in or go to a website to win. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only boxes they have are the ones with the event. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone from /v/ won one already. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad the archive died. #$%
@#$ $#@ cant you just get a relative in there to cheat for you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I eat there like 3 times a week. #$%
@#$ $#@ but then i'll be able to afford a PS4 after suing the shit out of taco bell #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because you like Taco Bell doesn't mean you'll like working there, faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ You won't be eating the food, you'll be making it and serving it for minimum wage, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taco Bell is fucking great considering the price #$%
@#$ $#@ Only texting charge is from your carrier if you pay as you go or some ancient plan like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ One code per day so you dont have to go eat 1300 calories each meal. #$%
@#$ $#@ I try to get in and out of fast food places as quickly as I can, because most of the employees in my area are scummy and annoying as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its this new thing called shit posting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have unlimited text so I think Im good on that regard. #$%
@#$ $#@ That means I have to text them right before midnight right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Assuming the Taco Bell isnt filled with code stealing niggers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can go to Taco Mayo and get three burritos and some nachos for the price of a chalupa meal at taco bell #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really, the ingredients are right there and then its just assemble tacos made to order. #$%
@#$ $#@ What, is this confirmed? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Im on my way to a gold Bloodborne machine. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is, but that stuff is murder for the body. #$%
@#$ $#@ More so than normal fast food. #$%
@#$ $#@ My autism is too high for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would rather pay the money just to dump the food out of the box myself than try to explain to some nigger manager that Im allowed to take a box because of some stipulation. #$%
@#$ $#@ I used to make burgers for myself all the time when I worked at Wendys. #$%
@#$ $#@ I made the Baconator before it was even on the menu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bacon on the bun, meat, bacon, meat, more bacon, cheese, more bacon, lettuce, mayo, bun. #$%
@#$ $#@ And that's why they're losing shitloads of money. #$%
@#$ $#@ People either want cheap, simple "I hate myself" food, or expensive, hip "I hate myself" food. #$%
@#$ $#@ McD is trying to play both sides, and fucking it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, they're fucking up this whole "breakfast all day" shit, since I'd rather have a proper chicken sandwich at 7 AM, not a fucking McMuffin at 6 PM. #$%
@#$ $#@ I missed the boat on that deal #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not one of those faggots who claim fast food is going to kill you, but every time I've had Taco Bell is get some fucking strong diarrhea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fucking up for me too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might have to try this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to wake around then for work anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not its just Taco Bell has been know as the cheapest place for decades so its going to take time before people notice that you get the same amount of food or more else where. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did anyone ever win that shit yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or ever? #$%
@#$ $#@ I am white trash by choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fast food is delicious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taco Bell has cross-promotion with both Dew and Doritos, so Taco Bell encompasses both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre delicious fresh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont let those bastards sit. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I eat taco bell once or twice a month and Ive never gotten anal explosions off of it once, not even the ghost pepper garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ What does that mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ sell the winning ticket/meal to your friend/family and pretend you dont know them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a huge difference between bad decisions when you are unaware of it and when you are consciously making bad decisions fully understanding how retarded you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those mcbuiscuts are dangerous. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ordered one and a drink and was late to class. #$%
@#$ $#@ I took a bite out of the buiscut and it crumbled in my mouth and soaked up my saliva. #$%
@#$ $#@ I started choking because I inhaled. #$%
@#$ $#@ I almost died trying to regain control of my car in traffic while fumbling to get my orange juice. #$%
@#$ $#@ So youve never once made a bet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or, say, lent money to a friend knowing they were a flake? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or have you just been that sheltered that you've never had to make decisions on your own #$%
@#$ $#@ Its all owned by pepsico. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never get diarrhea from Taco Bell. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mostly just get the chicken tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reverse image search reveals your feeble ruse. #$%
@#$ $#@ No ruse here sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ How many tries did this take you anon I might try it out #$%
@#$ $#@ 8 times this year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last year took me 5. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt play the first year. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather just throw down $350 and avoid getting diarrhea everyday from Taco Bell #$%
@#$ $#@ you have an anus that's used to taco bell #$%
@#$ $#@ And a better color. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill just wait till Black Friday for the price to drop even further. #$%
@#$ $#@ I grabbed a box for the volcano quesarito and didnt win so I stopped caring. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought they just had the gold and silver controllers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I degraded myself by eating at a horrible fast food chain #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive bought a few Taco Bell meals and got a winning code. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I was handsome, you'd be all over me and call me a genius, but since I am a SUPREME GENTLEMAN, you'll just laugh at me and go with Chad. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont mind me asking, at what time did you redeem your code? #$%
@#$ $#@ His picture shows 7:19 AM #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah 7:19 EST. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would usually pick a time between 5:00 and 8:00 AM. #$%
@#$ $#@ That isnt because youre sick anon, thats because the taco bell is just so god damned good your guts purge it out as quickly as possible so that you can shove more down your mouth. #$%
@#$ $#@ You underestimate the stupid that is the American lower class and fans that need to own everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ its shit normal quesarito is better #$%
@#$ $#@ And if you buy the Dew Big box that has 3 Dew themed foods you can get a code for entry at a chance of owning a Mt.Dew theme PS4! #$%
@#$ $#@ their nachos and cheese not the nachos that are covered in every ingredient in the damn restaurant are pretty good #$%
@#$ $#@ that sounds terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ thatll look good with my dewbox. #$%
@#$ $#@ It comes with dew flavored dorito tacos and an ICE cold taco flavored dew drink. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, some people like rare shit even though rare shit is still shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ your body eventually develops a tolerance to it #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah its like drinking soda again after staying away from it for years. #$%
@#$ $#@ It feels like fizzy acid going down your throat. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can barely drink soda anymore, it just feels so thick compared to water and it makes my teeth feel like theyre gonna fall out. #$%
@#$ $#@ but for some reason my body loves taco bell #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it actually real gold? #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course not #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus i already have a ps4 and A Limited edition could sell for a grand right? #$%
@#$ $#@ not much to reevaluate. #$%
@#$ $#@ gf wants to save money so she buys us taco bell once a week and we eat at home every other day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh gotcha. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much do you get paid? #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like the Beefy Fritos Burrito is the spiritual successor. #$%
@#$ $#@ The quality was nonexsistant on it, using grade E meat at best, rice is basically free, the tortilla is probably the most expensive part, and the "cheese" goo is not even food. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking love those things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get lunch for a buck, how great. #$%
@#$ $#@ they do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember crunchy tacos being like 87 cents and the bean burritos being like 79 cents and the double decker tacos being 99 cents. #$%
@#$ $#@ i also remember the McDonalds menu being actually good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean its still McDonalds but cheap food is cheap food. #$%
@#$ $#@ hell no, the fritos are just nasty filler. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is this semen demon? #$%
@#$ $#@ If it's tasty, cheap, and doesn't give me gastroenteritis they can use whatever grades of meat and cheese as far as I care #$%
@#$ $#@ Seasoning can make the worst meat taste good. #$%
@#$ $#@ taco bell employee here, yes you can : #$%
@#$ $#@ Me and my girlfriend both won one, once on my first visit and hers on our second. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know damn well nobody will believe me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spicy chicken sandwich #$%
@#$ $#@ its stoner food though #$%
@#$ $#@ Wendy's uses real food, most of their stuff for is actually pretty decent #$%
@#$ $#@ They're reportedly going to use more "natural" ingredients starting soonish, but they'll probably also shoot up in price #$%
@#$ $#@ You can just ask them to make something special for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right now if I ever find myself in a store, I get a chicken chilupa with fried potatoes and chipotle sauce sans sour cream because fuck that nasty ass shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's mold from gross spouts that don't get cleaned properly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not going to complain about extra cheese at a shitty fast food place, but the sour cream distribution is consistently terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always wanted all day breakfast from McDonald's but the one I typically go to isn't serving biscuits all day, only muffins. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of bullshit is that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I had the exact opposite problem with the previous late night breakfast menu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing but shitty dry biscuits, no english muffins. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too much of that shitty nacho cheese makes the rest of the burrito just cheese flavored mush. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can almost 100% guarantee that some company is just going to release a custom gold console and controller case to ride on the coattails of this sweepstakes so you might as well no waste a shit load on taco bell unless you already eat taco bell regularly. #$%
@#$ $#@ or just get a black one because gold as a color on anything that isnt real gold is fucking hideous. #$%
@#$ $#@ you could probably use Textfree app and if you lose change the phone number. #$%
@#$ $#@ What kind of meal deal is 3 dollars? #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never saw those anywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm buying an Xbox One because of this picture #$%
@#$ $#@ Spend 400 dollars and get a 7 dollar movie ticket. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nuggets even the spicy ones, homestyle chicken sandwich, junior burgers, and their fountain drinks #$%
@#$ $#@ I went there a week ago and bought one of these. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tastes like shit and they put my shit in a brown paper bag and when I asked for the fucking box with the code on it which is the whole point of ordering it they looked at me like I was crazy. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have the promotional shit plastered all over the menu and then they are too stupid to give you the box with the code? #$%
@#$ $#@ No dipshit I ordered the quesarito big box with a chance to win a gold PS4 but dont want my code. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't win and I don't plan on trying again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quesaritos are terrible and not even the trash can wants them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also I already have a PS4 so the novelty of a gold one isnt strong enough to want to eat nasty food. #$%
@#$ $#@ How many people actually win every time they do this? #$%
@#$ $#@ So youre stealing and bragging on /v/ for attention? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats good for you I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ I read my post again and just realized I sound really buttmad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh well. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should be friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ That food is awful for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ... #$%
@#$ $#@ just want that bloodborne box so bad #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, you should get what you paid for. #$%
@#$ $#@ The chicken crunchwrap sliders were the fucking shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its funny I would imagine a autistic person at the register blabbering on about how he is entitled to a free box. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also dont throw away food man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if its shit at least give it to a homeless guy or something #$%
@#$ $#@ HAHAHAH THATS OFFICIALLY THE FUCKING WORST DEAL EVER #$%
@#$ $#@ I do, got a free pass at EVO before it was even released. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it isn't the 90's anymore and Americans have moved on to new genres #$%
@#$ $#@ they werent good in the 90s either. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything worse #$%
@#$ $#@ This isn't anything new Americans are shitty at every genre of video games #$%
@#$ $#@ ive never seen a country try so hard and fail at something #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is there a guy wearing girls clothes #$%
@#$ $#@ what happened to mahvel? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say its because we dont have an arcade culture. #$%
@#$ $#@ ya we did and still sucked #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt like Asia had it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The arcade was a place to babysit your kids while you go shop at the mall. #$%
@#$ $#@ street fighter iv has been out forever and was massively popular #$%
@#$ $#@ Street Fighter 4 is more popular in the US than Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ignore him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes obviously stupid as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ No dedication, they just moved on to other stuff #$%
@#$ $#@ Not enough autism. #$%
@#$ $#@ But blacks placed higher than whites #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, and the fact that Americans can make it into the top 8 at EVO and other tourneys shows that were capable, but that we need to play the same game as Japan for years before we could even do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I be they can't beat me in budokai tenkaichi 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ is this why theyre better at ping pong too? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a big part of it, they can meet up relatively easily #$%
@#$ $#@ the only reason that happens is 99% of the entrants are american. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOu can bet your ass if there was evo japan there would be no americans in the top 16 #$%
@#$ $#@ Who are consistently better at fighting games, whites or blacks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Blacks actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ mk doesn't count, it's dominated by a gay teen furry #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would we want to be good at a dying genre? #$%
@#$ $#@ Blacks, Spics and Asians beat both of them up pretty bad in almost all fighting games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice OS friend #$%
@#$ $#@ why do certain players on the same team get more? #$%
@#$ $#@ Woah so blacks consistently place higher in tournaments controlling for the same opponents? #$%
@#$ $#@ They weren't always on the same team #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you trying to say here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you faced a black man at tekken yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing you fucking retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why did you write anything #$%
@#$ $#@ ahh alright wow why would anyone play that pile of shit league when the top earner comes in at 65th place #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant name any fighting game player that makes 100k a year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rofl, EVO was only like 5,000 dollars for first place #$%
@#$ $#@ wouldnt the better players make more money? #$%
@#$ $#@ Black people just run for president. #$%
@#$ $#@ This goes against every pattern in every sort of racial metric I have ever seen so its hard to believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can like something but I won't devote my entire life to it if I'm living in a ghetto apartment eating store brand food because the earnings from thousands of hours of practice are shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that why boxing is dead now #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh thats bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only reason team games are popular is so faggots can shove the blame if loss on someone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe fighting games are less popular for that alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ People need to point fingers, can't do that shit if you're the only one playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you not watching SCR? #$%
@#$ $#@ There wasn't even a white guy in top 32 #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop responding to me because it's safe to assume you're a dumb ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its two completely different things? #$%
@#$ $#@ Americans are just genetically inferior to Japanese #$%
@#$ $#@ Calm down sperg. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go shoot up a school, jason. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a support system so while they train they get paid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same with the chinese. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most NA teams are still Amature in the true sense of the word. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think anyone bothered to look at the image and went straight to shitposting #$%
@#$ $#@ I should have expected that #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd speculate it's more due to most of the Japanese scene sitting in the arcades and playing each other all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ UltraChen just have a very boring commentary style #$%
@#$ $#@ I know your illiterate, and probably not American, but try to at least pretend you arent stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jwong beats up 9-year old MK players on stream #$%
@#$ $#@ SFV was boring as fuck for me to watch, not Tekken tier boring but fuck I wanted to watch something else, 4 kinda has me still interested depending on the characters they choose #$%
@#$ $#@ why is the us is so shitty at everything? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the true answer. #$%
@#$ $#@ the irony #$%
@#$ $#@ Bonchan won so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its hilarious how even the french guy is asian. #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed, this game is going to be great. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont give a shit who else wants to play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just looks sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard work beats out talent almost always. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Asians practice 8 hours a day, an NA player gets that much practice in a week. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's funny how 2 of them are 09ers #$%
@#$ $#@ This isnt really fair. #$%
@#$ $#@ America has a lot of whites, chinks, and blacks so it has 3 groups specializing in all sorts of athletics. #$%
@#$ $#@ SonicFox is a gay black furry and made $100k this year #$%
@#$ $#@ then why dont american asians play fighting games #$%
@#$ $#@ Good for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was stuck in the anime dimension for a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good thing MKX has those giant bonuses. #$%
@#$ $#@ They do, but they are not playing 8 hours a day 5-7 days a week. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sweden surprises me, I've trashed hundreds of people during casual play and I'm mediocre. #$%
@#$ $#@ Must be 2-3 super-autists that are like gods among plebs. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is about olympic sports #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you think that image is for fighting games? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Jap killer, Youporn Filipinoman does pretty well for himself in fighting games #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon, I needed a laugh #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not culture. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its people practising hours a day for years vs a person that maybe gets in a few hours a week. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is it. #$%
@#$ $#@ how japanese stay so skinny even though they sit around playing all day? #$%
@#$ $#@ that and USF4 doesnt have True counter picks. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has good and bad matchups but not enough "HARD COUNTERS". #$%
@#$ $#@ Noodle soup. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty funny, years ago we had this notion that the japanese would never tier whore and were character loyalists for life, and that the west were the tier whores #$%
@#$ $#@ Daigo is a nurse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the asian players have "real jobs". #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese meals typically have modest portions and not nearly as much fattening stuff as ours do, and most likely all of them dont own cars and use public transportation so they do much more walking and standing every day than the average American gamer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure showed them #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate the entire philosophy behind the idea that total new comers should be able to be competitive with veterans. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the part where we laugh at you, you post your 50% win rate, and then we laugh even harder. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats pretty much how you train for anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ You burn it in for hours and you burn it in right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pays really well though for not needing a ton of schooling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which comes in handy for wanting to invest time in your hobbies like he does. #$%
@#$ $#@ It pays well and doesnt require anywhere near the time as becoming a doctor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like a pretty good gig overall. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong faggot, while working out will preserve more muscle while losing weight calories are the end all be all of losing weight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like that other anon said, you can run a marathon every single day and still gain fat if you eat too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ As do I. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will never make sense in either theory or execution, but dammit if Capcom wont stop talking about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like I said, I really want them to give this game a proper tutorial, from basic movements to inputs to linking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Trial and challenge modes are good, but theyre just not cutting it anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ As someone that almost gave up getting good at fighting because of this shit, trust me. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'd help them more than they'd ever know. #$%
@#$ $#@ owls are so fucking cool man #$%
@#$ $#@ Worse yet, theyre the fuckin majority now. #$%
@#$ $#@ An American made it into top 8 for Tekken 7, barely, but even still its incredibly impressive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont keep up with Tekken that much, but thats the new one thats still only in Asian arcades, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck thats impressive. #$%
@#$ $#@ sfa has air blocking and 100% combos, st is fireball city and has very limited movement options. #$%
@#$ $#@ these are major differences that completely change how the game is played. #$%
@#$ $#@ The differences between sf4 and sf5 are nothing compared to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ SF2 is really match up dependant. #$%
@#$ $#@ SFA3 has juggles with V-ism. #$%
@#$ $#@ SFA2 has the Valle CC. #$%
@#$ $#@ SF4 and SF5 are WAY different. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play fucking mobas or some other time sink you shitbag. #$%
@#$ $#@ I meant it more in the sense that there are universal tools that, if memorized, will make you a better player at fighting games, no matter what game, like footsies, spacing, zoning, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ People who understand and practice these tools will always be better than a completely new player. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even understanding things like basic controls and inputs will put someone on a completely different level than a newbie. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're not trading money for a new experience, you're trading money for the same experience you already spent way too much time with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not healthy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a load of this MD in retard sciences here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go suck a cock. #$%
@#$ $#@ The dude went to school, passed a bunch of fucking test and has some sort of education and at least half a brain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont try to give me shit about medical shit, Ive been listening to Dre for two decades. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre seriously surprised that some game genres fundamentals are universal in those genres? #$%
@#$ $#@ From what Ive gathered they are usually grunt bitches who do super important shit and take on big roles, just without proper recognition and without the ability to make big calls like the doctors because they arent allowed to. #$%
@#$ $#@ They definitely shouldnt, just saying. #$%
@#$ $#@ At what level of education? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know where you've been anon but Sweden has been taking most Melee majors as of late. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of those things are surprising or weird though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which country are you from? #$%
@#$ $#@ How does Mago ranked so high? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do your nurses get university degrees? #$%
@#$ $#@ nice meme! #$%
@#$ $#@ Id call it a party game #$%
@#$ $#@ if ur gonna use this as an argument atleast fix the numerous spelling and grammar errors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Besides that though, 100% correct. #$%
@#$ $#@ Justin works full time as a QA tester for Nvidia up in norcal now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would a party game be on a fighting game list anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Power Instinct: Matrimelee was pretty bad, no way its in top tier #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say smash is best described as a platform fighter. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has similarities to both genres and is somewhere in the middle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, some of the points in the picture arent entirely true or are just plain wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shield stabbing is essentially the same as high/low attacks, the main difference is that the shield needs to be small. #$%
@#$ $#@ The shield is essentially a block that instead of only getting broken after a certain threshold, also gets weaker and has to be aimed at where the attack is when its weaker. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know why he said hitstun isn't a thing, it definitely is although it is true that combos are a lot different due to other mechanics #$%
@#$ $#@ In that case every character has a counterhit because of powershield into literally anything serves the same function #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry kiddo, not a fighting game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every move has startup frames and end frames where the hitbox isnt active where a faster move will be able to punish it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only difference would be that they don't get special properties like a stagger or whatever the fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ If smash had no hitstun that would mean youd be able to do any move immediately out of being hit right? #$%
@#$ $#@ that would combos dont exist which is just incorrect. #$%
@#$ $#@ real people can't shoot laser beams out of their hands for one #$%
@#$ $#@ You get pushed back when you get hit you dont get stunned, you can freely attack/attempt to move while getting knocked back, the game has no hitstun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats like being mad that COD sells more than MGS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course the majority like spoonfed shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Smash, but calling it a fighting game is an insult to it and to fighting games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except you cant immidiatly move during knockback and you have no idea what you are talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ In 64 you literally can get killed off of one combo and while melee has a lot less hitsun, it still had hitsun nonetheless #$%
@#$ $#@ No, the game has no hit stun at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever you say, shitposter-kun #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you talking about US is literally good at no genre of video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But they are the best @ MKX and Killer Instinct. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jwong took a SBO #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much this. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's a fucking skeleton at this point and is only kept going by tradition #$%
@#$ $#@ whats your reasoning behind your comment? #$%
@#$ $#@ That anglos cant hope to beat other cultures that reward merits and skill. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are so many guides online for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again, theyd have to make it good. #$%
@#$ $#@ In-depth, but not overly talky, like the KI or Skullgirls ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ As far as your chart goes, no, I havent seen one, though we should probably make one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes cause we have to play games in the way how they are intended. #$%
@#$ $#@ If we go by that logic, games like starcraft / counter strike / dota wont even be made. #$%
@#$ $#@ And, in case anybody is waiting with bated breath for the next level - which no-body is - its in the works. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's why there's the star and cloud ideally #$%
@#$ $#@ Man am I glad to see 1-2 without those donut hole blocks #$%
@#$ $#@ My copy came in the mail today, what am I in for? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it a pain to unlock stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a way to do the 100 Mario challenge with just specific themes?SMW is my fav #$%
@#$ $#@ Has to be a drawing post, then you'll have the option in the upper leftist area #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have to post a comment in the stage? #$%
@#$ $#@ Going to Miiverse doesnt give me the option. #$%
@#$ $#@ you don't need to change the date, but you need to do everything else, I think it's about 30 mins. #$%
@#$ $#@ Think so #$%
@#$ $#@ There's only like 3 million levels uploaded m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you even realize how big that number is? #$%
@#$ $#@ Never, nintendo will cease to exist as a company before even a billion levels are uploaded #$%
@#$ $#@ where did you get that number? #$%
@#$ $#@ He almost looks like Chevy Chase. #$%
@#$ $#@ take the number of inputs per entry 36 and raise that to the number of possible inputs 16 #$%
@#$ $#@ Any chance of apple coming back eventually? #$%
@#$ $#@ Your main area is going to be where the flag is. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could start above ground, do the pipe to the water, then at the end of water pipe back up #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre first youngboi #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it, it was very fair but really looked exhilarating at times. #$%
@#$ $#@ And I always knew where to go and what to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice first level #$%
@#$ $#@ Where did you go to get a picture of your levels like this? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Delete blocks, put down enemies, random items, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just spamming blocks wont get you anywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to use everything they provide you before you receive notifications. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been trying yours for 15 minutes, its unbelievable but its tricky in parts. #$%
@#$ $#@ But every challenge is nicely ramped. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if I don't get to finish it, you certainly earned the star #$%
@#$ $#@ This whole unlocking stuff method is just draconian. #$%
@#$ $#@ Update: Still couldnt beat it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The yoshi double jump is pretty hard to land and the moving cannons are insidious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Great level, sorry for fucking up your clear rate #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll go back to it after I eat dinner, I'm on a bit of a time crunch. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll comment when I'm done. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's good enough to make me keep coming back #$%
@#$ $#@ Dev skip scum should be castrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna give this one a try later. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something came up. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its a good level. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has a difficulty curve and its believable as an actual mario level. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is pretty easy overall though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, most of the people who played that course completed it, it just took them a few tries, hence the clear percentage. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont have to change date to unlock stuff anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just spam blocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you just keep spamming, youll get the deliveries early. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a lot faster than resetting each time. #$%
@#$ $#@ God fucking damn it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was I the only one who actually made levels to unlock the new parts? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Use the new items as theyre unlocked, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I made a couple to test it out, but shit is so limited starting out. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will personally ignore and urge everyone else to ignore everything you fucking post if you spam individual levels per post like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I time travelled, since it was before or on the day of the patch when time travelling still worked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad I did since some people have trouble getting all the stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ The sad thing is, enough people died on those automatic stages for them to move from Easy to Normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really tells you about the playerbase. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hadnt thought of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could see people moving during a couple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the easy stages I got had the end just off screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sweet, thanks Tanix. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wish galoombas were in the other game modes, shaking them just kills them, it woulda been great if they could be brought in, to say mario 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking wish I would get any comments. #$%
@#$ $#@ This and having actual breakable blocks in the SMW mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ the SMW blocks definitely have their uses but also have limitations when compared to a breakable block from any of the other game modes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got a chance to try it. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be blunt, I cant beat it, I gave up. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I had to make a comparison, Break the Unbreakable is the stone containing Excalibur, waiting for the one who is truly worthy of wielding the sword. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately, I'm not Sir Arthur and I can't pull the sword out of the stone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill give you a star for being creative, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Press in one of the analog sticks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which one you press changes it from a left or right hand as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not fun at all tbh fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill try it, give me a little bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still shilling. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got to the part where you use the turtles to break the blocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ The first one just bounces right back off and goes to the hole between the pipe and the first step and just kills all the rest of the turtles that come out and then its clunky as hell to try and get the shell to go away out of a hole in SMB1. #$%
@#$ $#@ anything not a clearly labeled automatic goes to expert. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone else care to give these a shot? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lo farò! #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I guess Ill try that next time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think you have to remove the parakoopas but try to think of a subtle way of hinting at the warp pipe secret. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just realized where you were talking about, sorry. #$%
@#$ $#@ blame the streamers out there. #$%
@#$ $#@ we all would prefer great levels over this shit but these are the people who think games should be enjoyed not played. #$%
@#$ $#@ amiibos are just a shortcut. #$%
@#$ $#@ i have a collection of amiibos and got me around half of the avaliable costumes that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ there are some costumes that wont have an amiibo, and there is certain costumes you only get at certain difficulty levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you want Nikki you need to beat Easy enough times and you get Ashley if you beat Normal enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could try out mine, I feel similar to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ mission accomplished? #$%
@#$ $#@ I could be a bigger one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, Id be more than happy to try out yours in return. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fixed all the issues hopefully although it might make it harder since there should only be one way to beat it instead of like, five different ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Solid level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im definitely a fan of these kinds of levels that actually feel like they could be in a Mario game and not just epic maymay levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still working on my SMB3 castle level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill let you know when its done, if youll still be here that is. #$%
@#$ $#@ It may take 10-20 more minutes or so. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still have several ideas I wanna put into it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Um, yes... #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be... #$%
@#$ $#@ I finished my level, but I still have to playtest it so it may take a few more minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had enemies somehow falling through the solid ceiling near the beginning so there are some problems I need to fix. #$%
@#$ $#@ was pretty fun, I kept somehow killing the flying koopa cart thingy so I had to redo that boss fight like 4 times, I had fire flower / spiky helmet and yoshi but I think it was his shells that killed the thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ also give me your favorite levels from others and I will add them to the booru. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't need an account to upload btw #$%
@#$ $#@ Left a comment, I really liked it #$%
@#$ $#@ thats fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm surprised I haven't heard of it until now #$%
@#$ $#@ I was annoyed by all the swinging chain chomps at first but when I figured out what to do I liked it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ended up taking the fast route avoiding the underground to beat it. #$%
@#$ $#@ This level seemed a bit haphazard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked that there were many paths and you could run through the whole thing, but much of the geometry didn't feel symmetric and thus the whole thing didn't feel polished. #$%
@#$ $#@ Starred anyway so you can get a chance to upload that full set and improve as you go #$%
@#$ $#@ People have been posting with images from our profiles but it seems sparsely talked about. #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw more talk of it earlier, I guess it was just assumed everybody knew about it by this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be honest I didnt even anticipate that the top was possible to complete. #$%
@#$ $#@ It ended up being a happy accident that the name had 'crawl' in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad you ended up liking it #$%
@#$ $#@ Short and sweet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish there was a way to form communities within mariomakerhub, so we can have an outlet for all /v/ levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sure that will come as the site matures #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks to those who played and starred. #$%
@#$ $#@ Going backwards from my post and playing levels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beat it with some sick bulletbill hops. #$%
@#$ $#@ you could do that with the booru but obviously it has a lot less features #$%
@#$ $#@ Its cool to see a Mario 3 level that is normally dark looking with normal overworld textures. #$%
@#$ $#@ I beat it only because I am very familiar with this level and play Mario 3 a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think maybe we should use the booru strictly for a level dump. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like every time you post a level you also just put it in the booru, and people looking to play a backlog can just go there #$%
@#$ $#@ This was easy but fun #$%
@#$ $#@ I know thats the case if the block itself isnt destroyed, but yes thats the only exception I know of. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not sure what happens if you gib the block though. #$%
@#$ $#@ says it at the top of your user page - button in course world #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, my original idea was to have you swim from boo circle to boo circle and I was really disappointed to learn you cant position the gap in the boo circle where ever you want it, that way it would flow more naturally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im probably gonna tweak it a bit, thanks for the feedback. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I mostly only care about is the fun factor. #$%
@#$ $#@ The last level I made few weeks ago was dickish as fuck with its design, so I wanted to make my next level much easier by removing any point where you can easily die on your first few try and break the flow of the level even if it would make it a bit easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets not forget that its only the first level out of 31 more Im going to make in the campaign anyway and the difficulty is going to ramp up bit by bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could make a manual boo circle using tracks. #$%
@#$ $#@ check his mii and scroll through his levels, if its not there he took it down. #$%
@#$ $#@ The pow blocks kill things. #$%
@#$ $#@ The ones on the side are used to kill jr so he doesn't spam at you and a chomp if you're lucky. #$%
@#$ $#@ You gotta get the one in the eye, if you look real close at whats happening there you should be able to figure it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also make sure to retreat to the E tank room after you get hit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wont affect your progress in killing the boss, but it will reset the enemies/pow blocks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldnt get past the part with the spiny and the goomba, which I got to I think twice out of about 40 tries. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much did I have left? #$%
@#$ $#@ The 458 is actually how many tries people have made, so 27 people have given it 458 tries between them. #$%
@#$ $#@ After you jump the spiny, you avoid the goomba, and grab the spring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then, you jump through the powerup filter piranha plant, and wait for the platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just as the corner of it comes out, you land on the platform and drop the spring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Early before you reach the spike wall, you bounce off the spring into another helmet, which you then jump through a plant again with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then it because a blitz of helmets and plants, basically helmet, plant, helmet, plant, helmet, plant, then you jump early to get a helmet early, and jump into the spike cave and go through a plant to get a helmet to go through a plant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you jump and get a helmet avoiding the spike top, go through plant, get a fire flower, jump to avoid the spikes keeping the flower without getting hurt, grabbing the last helmet, and blitzing up a spike staircase, just in time to hit the goal with no powerups left. #$%
@#$ $#@ You had made it past the longer stuff besides the spring jump. #$%
@#$ $#@ After that, it was just a blitz of fast helmet managing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the number next to the feet next to the number of people who starred your level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sweet, thanks dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt know what that was. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck you #$%
@#$ $#@ You know whats not cool? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dropping out of a pipe into damage, or death if you didnt have a costume at that point. #$%
@#$ $#@ A single spring in the middle of a bed of lava in a long stage with no checkpoints is pretty bullshit too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice concept but having to sit around for 5 hours hoping the magikoopa hits the right block to attempt to clear the stage isnt worth it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't even notice them until someone pointed them out #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the #literal #DarkSouls of #SuperMarioMaker #$%
@#$ $#@ i bet you just love crt vs filter threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ The stage was fine the problem is that it was two hard stages that happened to be stuck together. #$%
@#$ $#@ Two medium challenges make one hard challenge for example, so two hard challenges make one insane challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario 3 had drop shadows on some of its platforms. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ, thats hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well designed, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I beat Bowser Jr. #$%
@#$ $#@ then gave up and went to bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill see if I can beat it tomorrow. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had absolutely zero idea for a title. #$%
@#$ $#@ alliterations and rhymes man, not internet references #$%
@#$ $#@ I get that you were trying to make something neat with it, and it was, but try to refrain from using glitches in the editor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who knows what will happen to your stage if/when its fixed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right, but after you hit the shell into the 3 spinies, it just bounces there forever, so you have to soak a life there. #$%
@#$ $#@ And if you don't have the mushroom anymore, you just automatically lose #$%
@#$ $#@ i have a hunch mario maker glitches will have a Vanellope von Schweetz effect and will probably remain as long as the glitches arent bricking consoles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even the guy that made it, but you serious? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a pipe shitting out turtles next to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use one shell to cancel the next. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive died a few times on 100 Mario challenge just by not reading the title. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I hate note block and springs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never use them in hard platforming sections. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a ruse, or are you actually coming to this website just to advertise your Mario Maker levels? #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, I got to the boss and died instantly, not even sure how. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre level is fantastic, you should be proud. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just too tired and done today to play it well. #$%
@#$ $#@ A+, I starred it a half hour ago #$%
@#$ $#@ arent we all shilling our levels? #$%
@#$ $#@ Posting a few more .webms before Im out of here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hope the thread is up in the morning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck note blocks, but Ill give any level inspired by dkc a try. #$%
@#$ $#@ So far, its made to where each section is the question, do I climb up fast, or do I climb up slowly? #$%
@#$ $#@ Some sections have slow moving enemies that give you time to climb slowly, while others start fast and you have to climb up fast to a certain point to avoid early appearing stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes too much time to have to hit a block to have a vine to climb. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel its easier to just appear, see the slow moving grinder move forward to climb the vine, and know you need to climb it to avoid getting minced. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll copy them down and play them tomorrow, I'm off to bed right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ i can't try all of these tonight but i'll get around to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, knowing where to start with a difficulty curve is pretty tough. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know even DKCs first few levels can give people a challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill ramp it up in the coming worlds. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never claimed that you said that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was just telling you that your level gave off more of a temple vibe than a desert one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still enjoyed it for what it was. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just felt some parts needed a little bit more stuff in them to keep the player busy exploring each section instead of running past everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ missed quote, derp #$%
@#$ $#@ Got stumped bad on the first two. #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldn't figure out how to get the mushroom to follow me through the spikes, and I couldn't figure out how to make the path for the mushroom for the blue platforms. #$%
@#$ $#@ But regardless, they are all great so far. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kiwi is my favorite so far as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ done, the platform section almost gave me a stroke, was fun regardless, starred #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to make a level like this but I still havent unlocked Peach after twenty 100 Mario runs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I originally wanted to make a Bowser level where you exit your castle to kill Mario directly, but I unlocked the Peach costume first so it all worked out #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna be playing through your levels now, since you and the other guy were able to beat my Tanked Up Trouble level. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will star what I like, and attempt to beat what I can, even though Im not that good at Mario huehue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except there were #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone couldnt get past the rats eh? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you serious right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ The smell would be worse Id assume. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy FUCK #$%
@#$ $#@ So are you going to go in depth on this or are you just going to waste everyone's time that's being wasted already by being here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Go pay for mods bethdrone #$%
@#$ $#@ painful to read #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you give us reasons why you hate it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern and older Fallouts, you dont have to chose one or the other. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are free to enjoy or not enjoy something as you experience it. #$%
@#$ $#@ why steal when you can convince their face with a 12 gauge #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't even get what's wrong with that #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no idea on the percentages or even if the achievement exists but please tell me reverse pickpocketing explosives onto people still exists? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's something you'd see on Cartoon Network as a joke. #$%
@#$ $#@ the infallibility is just a tangent to what it said, it has absolutely no bearing on the way it was programmed or its self awareness #$%
@#$ $#@ Why didnt you like it OP? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre somewhat correct. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bethesda didn't fuck up the series, it was already garbage and it's still garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ All evidence points to Fallout 4 being garbage too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Return yourself to /b/. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont know anything about video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Talking the down the boss in Fallout 1 made sense, tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regardless, having the option to talk your way out of something is ALWAYS a plus. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont talk down a boss through speech. #$%
@#$ $#@ You talk to a stationary, impotent computer and convince it to terminate itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no other way to beat it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You either talk it into killing itself or just leave it there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking hell, I forgot how simplistic the writing in Bethesda games is. #$%
@#$ $#@ There were Fallout games before 3 and NV? #$%
@#$ $#@ CAN'T WAKE UP #$%
@#$ $#@ WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you, I have 300 hours and I roleplay a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just don't like faggy thief characters #$%
@#$ $#@ I was gonna say that I regret it too but I played it for like 24 hours straight the weekend it came out so I cant say I didnt get my moneys worth. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only played the game the day it came out and have not touched it since. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing beats the hammer Anon #$%
@#$ $#@ What would a double diagonal be? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks man, last bit was fun #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought I earned those, honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tippers can be pretty hard in Sm4sh #$%
@#$ $#@ I was getting my ass handed to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good job Dr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I'm too good #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK you #$%
@#$ $#@ What happened? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kirby got hit by Little Mac and fell off the stage in rock form #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope someone saved the replay #$%
@#$ $#@ I did,it was too strange not to #$%
@#$ $#@ Woah say what you will about me but talk sgit about the best Regi Steel one more time and I'm finna pop ya #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting fucked in the ass by a shark is more enjoyable than fighting Jigglies, though #$%
@#$ $#@ You were actually doing pretty well there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good match Bojack. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gotta stop using the phantom so frequently in 1v1s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good Lucas nevertheless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because point matches mean shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whoever plays more matches gets a better score. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can score third place twelve times by lucking out and getting a bunch of short matches, while one guy gets a single win in a long match against actual skilled players, and gets less points than you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded or did you not understand what I wrote? #$%
@#$ $#@ That picture is pretty cool, but why is Lucina flying in the opposite direction? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was suuuch bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek, you ginormous fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe she doesnt like Palutena. #$%
@#$ $#@ because this #$%
@#$ $#@ ur bad kiddo ; #$%
@#$ $#@ I-I wasnt really trying. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have this bad habit of easing up on my opponent when I have a lead. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have literally never played a coin match in my life. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's fun in FFA's #$%
@#$ $#@ So start one then, if you're so great #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess thats what I get for playing at 1 am. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not trying to downplay the punch, it probably wouldve gotten me any time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just felt a bit sluggish in general that match. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre free to make a normal tournament. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wanted to try it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like to support those thighs, Kinoku, but not through pre-ordering. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's on indiegogo, and it needs money, it's not preordering. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, she is so lewd... #$%
@#$ $#@ I only want to touch her spats. #$%
@#$ $#@ gtfo su fan #$%
@#$ $#@ I played the demo for a few minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope it gets more depth added to the combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would love to see Anja pull off crazier combos. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know theyre adding air juggling, ability to switch between enemies faster, and a lot of other stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that so you know exactly what to expect when the monster kills you? #$%
@#$ $#@ Phantasmagoria is pretty good, though i havent played it in about 17 years so i dont know how well it holds up #$%
@#$ $#@ How about forgetting all that modern bullshit "horror", and playing some actual survival-horror for a change? #$%
@#$ $#@ Namely games like Silent Hill 1-4, Resident Evil REmake and 2, etc? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only horror game I have trouble playing is containment breach. #$%
@#$ $#@ How did you push through to keep playing though? #$%
@#$ $#@ if thats how you feel, then dont play their previous games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your heart might give way. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, soma is pretty tame compared to other horror games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something like that, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like a reminder that Oh yeah, all these things can really do is send me back to a checkpoint. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is still a video game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do the zombies even present a viable threat in DayZ or were you more afraid of the players? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is really helpful, thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you talking about Pressure? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the only fake game I remember from the old Deep Sea threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people always recommend resident evil games? #$%
@#$ $#@ The writing is god awful, the characters are walking cliches, and the horror elements are garbage since you always have a bunch of ammo and guns. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the fucking puzzles are just so nonsensical with collecting shit to open everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont get why people think its even remotely close to the silent hill leagues of horror. #$%
@#$ $#@ to add*. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its late. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aww shit ye, I dont suppose you have the screen cap of the thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Doom isn't supposed to be a horror game tho #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck you on about #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you fucking blind? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off you cunt, I cant see anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ is that hitler in the windows? #$%
@#$ $#@ how does that guy produce enough force to cut anything with those shears using one hand? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it was ok #$%
@#$ $#@ INSANE NANOMACHINES SON #$%
@#$ $#@ he uses these a lot i guess #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldnt handle evil within and used some guides to calm my nerves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Usually for horror I spoil it to get me through. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like horror but in reality I'm too much of a pussy and can't handle it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't even finish FEAR and tossed to game box in the corner of my room and its been there for like 7 years or whenever it was first released #$%
@#$ $#@ how the hell can you be scared when you're too busy laughing at the 12 year olds you shot in the ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Tip for FEAR, Alma and other spooks can't actually do anything to hurt you until very the end when you're shooting ghosts. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should go play it, great shooter, not so scary of a game though really #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some servers are better than others, and not everyone is going to kill you on sight, but I'd say it's like 50/50 if you get shot on sight or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt a fan of the night hunter creatures. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the creepy environment. #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoyed it though despite most people saying its like RE. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe it's because I haven't touched RE since nemesis and the creepy setting was enough to spook me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still have deadspace to go through and going to do my best not to spoil it to take that scary edge off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do people get desensitized after a while? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like horror but I can't handle it #$%
@#$ $#@ not great horror but a decent action game #$%
@#$ $#@ with Dead space once you get comfortable with the controls you quickly realize you are walking death, Isaac can stomp so hard that he severs limbs, think about how much force is required for that, he would be the final boss of some other game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah Ill get around to it but I want to play alien isolation and finish deadspace before I do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant wait for Halloween since its my favorite holiday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna play and watch a horror film #$%
@#$ $#@ Magnetic boots m80. #$%
@#$ $#@ DS is the sequel series to RE 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ anon, I... #$%
@#$ $#@ Dead space 3 was bretty gud. #$%
@#$ $#@ , son #$%
@#$ $#@ which raises a point, why hasnt Dr Who reused the vashta nerrada again? #$%
@#$ $#@ They were a cool spooky villain/monster #$%
@#$ $#@ oh fuck i forgot about that, yeah that was dumb #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember that horrible loud noise right before the engine room? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a sound one of the devs heard every day taking the train home #$%
@#$ $#@ I must be retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somebody help me and point out what the fuck I should be looking for in this image. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get from reading through that whatever 'it' is is in a window, but they all look the same to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just thought it was a random shot of a daytime part of cry of fear #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah its kinda meh compared to 1 and 2 but judged on its own merits its a pretty decent action game with a few minor horror elements. #$%
@#$ $#@ hive ships aren't literally moons with tentacles #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it would be an overrated shit meme game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually loved it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant wait for the sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Requiem for the puzzles, though the donkey kong bit was really stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Devin, go to bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ This, just everything in a secret containment facility waiting to fuck you in every orifice at the same time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just mod in some duct tape. #$%
@#$ $#@ i get bored and cant immersed because i start thinking about other shit and the horror has no effect #$%
@#$ $#@ That's quite a recommendation, I'll check it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats that? #$%
@#$ $#@ oh jesus I just googled it #$%
@#$ $#@ I got into Second World once and after some interesting architecture, someone invited me to some sort of pedophile furry rape dungeon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Quit and never came back. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU WERE TOO LATE #$%
@#$ $#@ This 7? #$%
@#$ $#@ IN YOUR NIGHTMARES #$%
@#$ $#@ anon if you have to feel justified in spending money on something through the approval of random strangers on the internet, then you're not really happy with it are you #$%
@#$ $#@ THATS A 9, YOU BIG SILLY. #$%
@#$ $#@ i know this thread is bait, but ill never get this gayming gear meme, like the more they fuck up the design the more it appeals to 12 year olds? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do people actually buy these things? #$%
@#$ $#@ get a real keyboard, faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ That just looks unpleasant. #$%
@#$ $#@ My nigga Corsairs keyboards are great. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love their clean industrial aesthetic. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much did you pledge comrade? #$%
@#$ $#@ This might actually be interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still probably going to go with a Warthog or CH stick, but having the keyboard and HOTAS as a single unit is something I always thought was a neat idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ is that a temperature gauge or music ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the LED for? #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off cunt, stop posting your shitty keyboard on other boards just because /g/ doesn't want to play nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually incredibly comfy and adjustable. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only agreed upon downside if RAT mice is how ugly they are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise, theyre perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ How many times are you going to make this thread OP? #$%
@#$ $#@ Until I like it? #$%
@#$ $#@ its FUTURISTIC! #$%
@#$ $#@ I was thinking about that keyboard, but ended up getting a logitech g710 for like $60 a bit ago at frys. #$%
@#$ $#@ That might of been the cheapest you could get a keyboard with mx blues. #$%
@#$ $#@ i meant to add that when you think like this any hobby or activity seems dumb #$%
@#$ $#@ This is you #$%
@#$ $#@ this thread again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Autistic as fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks man #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive got to be honest, if they made the face plate out of wood and only made the edges/feet brass, I might actually want that thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ dear god my eyes #$%
@#$ $#@ The only way it could be edgier is if you glued razor blades to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bumping this so other can see your master paint work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wonderful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit even in picture form it hurts my eyes #$%
@#$ $#@ Not OP, but a gtx 750 can play all modern games. #$%
@#$ $#@ That doesn't mean you'd want to use it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You also wouldnt want to shell out for a Titan X. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best choice is to get something inbetween. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either kailh switches or a cheap mechanical like the CM Quickfire are the objective best options. #$%
@#$ $#@ most retarded thing i've ever read #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sorry about your legitimate autism anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id buy one of these just to have a good fucking laugh every time I see it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its great. #$%
@#$ $#@ So far best 15 bucks i spent. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the hell are those two peripherals on the top? #$%
@#$ $#@ hourly dose. #$%
@#$ $#@ for free. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo should have localized XBX months ago instead of dragging their feet #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes Im sure the Wii U will sell millions with Xenoblade, such a popular and mainstream game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id buy #FE out of sheer curiosity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I cant wait for #FE. #$%
@#$ $#@ The butthurt will be glorious #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't wait for SMT IV-2 to outsell #FE #$%
@#$ $#@ Wolly World is almost as good as yoshis island though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't wait to buy both of them #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes because the Wii U is overflown with 2D platformers right? #$%
@#$ $#@ For the Wii U library, yes #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing personnel kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ that was some gangster shit tho #$%
@#$ $#@ says you... #$%
@#$ $#@ can I just emulate this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ gangsta shit #$%
@#$ $#@ The same reason they had to rerecord the audio in the first place dingus #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn strait it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disagree on all fronts. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hate how this scene took place at night in TTS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ruined the whole contrast the original version of the scene had. #$%
@#$ $#@ It depends on who does the over the top thing when they do it and how often said character does it boyo. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate the backtracking parts in 1 and twin snakes fixes em so yeah I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ *moves goalposts* #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain why, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ I personally feel if you're going to have your character be the most over the top badass in cutscenes and you don't let him be the most over the top badass in gameplay, you should either change your gameplay mechanics or tone down the movie bits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the only thing you can disagree with is the first sentence you thick cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ i am not any of the people you are talking to, i jsut came to this thread to shitpost. #$%
@#$ $#@ calm down faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel when Im the god of CQC and in gameplay beat a giant mobile nuclear fortress 1v1 I fit the bill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Snake is a super solider with the worst genes out of the batch, "magical vampire" is literally just a guy with nanomachines #$%
@#$ $#@ but muh convoluted mgs story! #$%
@#$ $#@ This is so fucking autistic I can't even #$%
@#$ $#@ snake is autistic #$%
@#$ $#@ Music and atmosphere doesnt exactly capture the same feeling from the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 &gt; 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ I audibly keked #$%
@#$ $#@ twin snakes features a shoehorned bossfight with a mega-zoid. #$%
@#$ $#@ how is that even stealth? #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon stop making sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS Twin Snakes had all the original voice actors. #$%
@#$ $#@ sons of liberty features a shoehorned boss fight with george weeaboo bush. #$%
@#$ $#@ how is that even stealth? #$%
@#$ $#@ Completely agree #$%
@#$ $#@ Who cares, its the canon version. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you talk like a faggot you can make anything sound stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I, too, think it was V #$%
@#$ $#@ We can learn a thing or two from you then #$%
@#$ $#@ Metal Gear Rising and Metal Gear Solid are not in the same series. #$%
@#$ $#@ You clearly cannot tell the difference between down to earth and realistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only you care. #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain the exact same thing he just did in a down to Earth manner, because he was clearly just shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ They changed the voice of the Cyborg Ninja from the DARPA Chief to Wacko Warner. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this loss? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mother fucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Says the guy who first brought it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ And it was for the better because who wants a white ninja to sound like a black man with asmeah? #$%
@#$ $#@ then why did mei ling and naomi lose their accents from mgs1 to 4? #$%
@#$ $#@ the accents were racist #$%
@#$ $#@ that mei lings ass and naomis titties tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes retarded because of the recessive genes. #$%
@#$ $#@ She doesnt look that different, her face is just a bit longer. #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking all those old men to gain a position in the navy can do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ That and OP is pretty retarded I admit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were talking about MGS1 here. #$%
@#$ $#@ the nigger sucked is that your point? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill give you the soundtrack though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong, Paulsen convoyed the scene much better, and not in a mellow dramatic, hamfisted way like the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ The same can be said of everyone else in Twin Snakes, their performance was more grounded as opposed to hamming it up like in the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ man how can you say TTS version is better because he was more "grounded"? #$%
@#$ $#@ It shits all over the games original cutscenes by being over the top garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ TTS sucks shit and you should admit it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Images speak louder than words. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its retardedly over the top and flashy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Way too much style over substance. #$%
@#$ $#@ but general consensus is that 5 is bad also.....oh, nice bait image I mean u got me #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong, Paulsen convoyed the scene much better, and not in a mellow dramatic, hamfisted way like the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ The same can be said of everyone else in Twin Snakes, their performance was more grounded as opposed to hamming it up like in the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima probably used TTS voice clips either because of some kids of rights issue for the older versions or because supposedly Kojima was super butthurt about the localized script of the original game that changed around some of the more awkward lines of dialogue and word choices to sound more natural and had the guy who localized the original games script fired. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it would make sense that he would want the more accurate translation of the script to represent the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt make it better though. #$%
@#$ $#@ God fucking dammit #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't use nanomachines as an excuse anon #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not an excuse, it's what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre making inaccurate statements about the game, Im telling you that you clearly havent played it and are just parroting the opinion /v/ has told you to have. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you an automaton? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have the ability to think for yourself? #$%
@#$ $#@ Using QTEs to finish bosses is fine though, it feels better than just attack them until they explode. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 games and a soundtrack?? #$%
@#$ $#@ No, they really didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game was far easier to play thanks to first person POV, and Im not even talking about the Ocelot fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ The level layout stayed exactly the same as the original, which really didnt work with the new gameplay model. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was handled poorly. #$%
@#$ $#@ BUT THE CUTSCENCES ARE STUPID! #$%
@#$ $#@ Game looks great upscaled on an emulator though #$%
@#$ $#@ THIS IS SO STUPID WHAT THE FUCK #$%
@#$ $#@ More like contractual obligations #$%
@#$ $#@ dont guards also have body armor and glass riot shields? #$%
@#$ $#@ its been a while since I played. #$%
@#$ $#@ During alert phase yeah, they do the whole clearing room thing as well #$%
@#$ $#@ literally perfect game and dont let jaded faggot /v/irgins say otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ so the whole package puzzle was only in the twin snakes, or was that also in the ps1 version? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima probably had no choice in the use of TTS voices, seeing how hes more involved with the Japanese voice acting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the DARPA chief suddenly became Grey Fox in the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really much prefer the voice acting in the remake and find nothing wrong with it, just a shitty meme hardcore sonyfans believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly they would have eaten this game up if it were on the PS2 instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can agree the Matrix shit is over the hill, but I guess because of them nanomachines, son. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still my favorite part in this game is Ocelot getting use to having one hand. #$%
@#$ $#@ just like in my opinion metal gear solid 4 has better gameplay than 3 but I still consider snake eater to be the better game #$%
@#$ $#@ I see, thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ But, Solid Sneak did have nanomachines at Shadow Moses... #$%
@#$ $#@ It was in the PS1 version, too, though its Campbell that tells you that her codec should be on the back of the CD case instead of Baker. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like that phrasing is better than TTSs because package sounds like it could be an in-game item. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can get through Twin Snakes with no deaths up until that point. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear, its like grabbing the ledge is randomized. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should probably look up Action 52 #$%
@#$ $#@ Ocelot is only shown shooting with his predominately with his right hand until MGS3, the one time he uses his left is to shoot the PAL card out of snakes hand #$%
@#$ $#@ I know Action 52 was an unlicensed game that retailed for a ridiculous amount of dosh, and that Twin Snakes was a standard, licensed release. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id hardly call the two comparable. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its kinda rare, I remember having to rebuy it because young-me left one of the discs in a drawer and it got all scratched up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was still selling for retail price even though it had been out for 5 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ do you remember the homosexual water-walking vampire and the fat guy on rollerskates? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those were REAL and not at all dumb or goofy, snake doing backflips ruined my immersion #$%
@#$ $#@ you remember when snake was doing all those crazy things in games that werent twin snakes? #$%
@#$ $#@ the issue is that Snake wouldnt do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gray Fox going ham vs metal gear , that works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Making Snake CUH-Rayzee doesn't #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I lost my first copy in a move, and found a discs only one at Gamestop a while back for cheap. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I had a box and manual for it, but I can never find them for sale individually #$%
@#$ $#@ dat blatent samefag #$%
@#$ $#@ None of that is more ridiculous than anything Raiden did in MGS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could argue the same for MGS2, there is virtually no difference between the two games #$%
@#$ $#@ except in this case its not really exploiting the game when thats the intended use for FPS mode #$%
@#$ $#@ The level design between the two games is very similar and deliberately so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both feature cramped corridors and small rooms with a 3-4 guards that you have to sneak past. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you up the difficulty to extreme TTS is quite a challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS1 was stupidly easy and the penalties for being spotted were pretty miniscule compared to MGS2/TTS, where you have an entire phase of "evasion" and clearing where the guards actively search for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ In some rooms, like the hanger the guards are fairly far apart but then take areas like the one before mantis or in the nuclear disarmament area where the guards patterns pass by each other or are in direct line of site. #$%
@#$ $#@ Near the end of the game they remove that god awful gun-camera room and place 3 guards inside that can all see each other. #$%
@#$ $#@ REXs hangar also has an increased number of guards. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was a fair amount of thought put into the design and balance of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you stupid? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a metaphor, i.e., Snake was the straight man compared to all of the wacky characters in FOXHOUND. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesnt literally mean a strange land as the setting of the fucking game. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn, go back to high school and take an English class. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can breeze right through MGS1 as well by abusing the soliton radar. #$%
@#$ $#@ The guards are blind and deaf in that game, I prefer TTS because they react to you in a more realistic way, the first person aim does make some rooms easier than they would be without it but its not like they just threw that shit in without any consideration. #$%
@#$ $#@ like where? #$%
@#$ $#@ what can you skip with hanging mode? #$%
@#$ $#@ Made your bait way too obvious with the last 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ It's amazing, isn't it? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can repost this thread every single day and it will always get this much attention. #$%
@#$ $#@ what's the problem with it #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he means because you posted Xbox versions and not Playstation versions. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont really think it matters, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ This one is fucking cool #$%
@#$ $#@ lol u got troled you stupd i fuck ur mom eat the shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it was obvious from the 3DS version of Snack Eater, and the fucking novelization of 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ And some people like the third Transformers movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ You liking something that sucks dick doesn't mean others shouldn't be able to make fun of it for being terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ what's wrong with the 3ds version of snake eater #$%
@#$ $#@ accidental greentext, my b #$%
@#$ $#@ TTS footage was in 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ TS was better, but nostalgia always wins apparently. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatever helps you sleep at night #$%
@#$ $#@ right here #$%
@#$ $#@ be careful what you wish for #$%
@#$ $#@ Cancelled in favor of Metal Gear Pinball. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not bad for slow days at work. #$%
@#$ $#@ No wi-fi, plenty of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Despite its flaws, to be fair it's really great having MG, MG2, MGS2, and MGS3 portable even though MGS3D is the better portable MGS3 but Vita MGS3 isn't bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you dont use the MGS2 features they added in. #$%
@#$ $#@ They kinda break the difficulty. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one emotes in TTS at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know why TTS defenders think emoting = hammy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keyword is fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that the original is better in performance but the VA in TTS isnt bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also what do you men by hammy #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga, grey foxs voice in the original sounds like a shattered man thats held together by a couple screws and lust for battle, in twin snakes hes generic robot voice number 48, then in the end it sounds like hes reading off a teleprompter but cant see the words clearly because he forgot his glasses. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know much about the original script but the dinosaur theme park line is still there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it looks like shit, but comfy level over graphics, what´s the command? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ctrl + Space #$%
@#$ $#@ floris is dogshit #$%
@#$ $#@ I had no idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there something better that replaces it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there any mods that let you just be a hired goon in a lords army? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just move wherever your lord moves and not have a party of your own, and then after the campaigning is done just retire to your plot of land? #$%
@#$ $#@ I picked this up because it seem to be the one game that /v/ has agrred upon being, at worst, meh. #$%
@#$ $#@ what's wrong with bannerlord #$%
@#$ $#@ well i cant criticise something that does not or will ever exist, so idk #$%
@#$ $#@ they cancelled it? #$%
@#$ $#@ About what? #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a lot of shit they need to wrap up and they only have 1 episode to do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Expecting mild disappointment. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't know what this is and I don't really care, tbh. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel the same way about Tales from the Borderlands and Game of Thrones too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see how any of them will wrap up in just one episode unless theyre longer episodes than what weve been getting. #$%
@#$ $#@ no because hype is a dumb american word that just leads to disappointment #$%
@#$ $#@ damn son you're missing out #$%
@#$ $#@ not even but alright, go watch it on youtube #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want to see her get shot in the head and raped after death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if they decided to scrap the shitty Telltale style gameplay in favor of a system that is actually fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also Max has to escape in the first place #$%
@#$ $#@ please delete this #$%
@#$ $#@ post more diaper max #$%
@#$ $#@ there's some weird anti-fandom around LiS who produce shit like this, I've actually never seen it happen to another game before #$%
@#$ $#@ that was a single page, and people legitimately hate Lightning as a character #$%
@#$ $#@ There's sfm stuff for about every somewhat popular game out there, it's like you don't even browse /gif/ #$%
@#$ $#@ snuff means death, that's just the definition #$%
@#$ $#@ I lost the pic, but somone out there has a detailed list of diologu showing how the chick who has a crush on jeffetson in in on the dark room thing, and that jefferson was supposed to be the bad guy from the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, I will enjoy playing it on youtube, friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ shitposters have posted this in literally every LiS thread I've seen in the past few weeks #$%
@#$ $#@ didnt they like, take a photo before the party and the shit happened? #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldnt she just do the same shit she did with the other photo? #$%
@#$ $#@ literally linked it in that post #$%
@#$ $#@ I still finished the game though #$%
@#$ $#@ is max a virgin? #$%
@#$ $#@ this is important because she is mai waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ It made since when i read it, i would post if it i had it but the phone that had it the pic died #$%
@#$ $#@ there isn't anything in the game that discounts her being a virgin imo, and the fact that the developers have been ambiguous about her sexuality and given the player so much leeway to flirt around with Chloe might even mean she's just a virgin by circumstance #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like they added this scene just to say Chloe wasnt actually a lesbian even though everybody assumed she was. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cannot imagine that any guy would honestly even want to tap such a pathetic ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ God knows her sad excuse for a personality doesnt help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her best shot for a sexual encounter involves roofies. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wanna fuck the living shit out of here #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe not hyped, but definitely ready to see how it ends. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is IF I can pull myself away from MGSV. #$%
@#$ $#@ You got quite a bit wrong in that shitpost of yours. #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved the series up until Other M, but if thats what the future of the franchise holds, then I guess I am no longer the intended demographic of Metroid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am sure the new fans will support it for years to come, and will help it remain a successful flagship series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remodeled Shitholeism #$%
@#$ $#@ there's nothing wrong with having your shithole remodeled #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you even a Space Pirate? #$%
@#$ $#@ The entire symbolism of an "echo" is of their being a copy of something. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's referring to the two worlds, as well as to Dark Samus, as they're both "echoes" of the original thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess its nod to how similar the Aether situation is to Tallon Foreign body hits aplanet and slowly destroys it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just don;t know why until Corruption. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or maybe Retro just thought it sounded cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ goddamn he looks like a greasy hobo #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes always reminded me of a Japenese version of John Romero. #$%
@#$ $#@ in the giant chasm on Phaaze in 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, see, theres the problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive only ever played Corruption once....and that was when it first came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats one thing I DO remember, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called Metroid Prime because the Chozo just named it that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It isnt actually Metroid at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least, according to MP1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Science #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, my bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Space Pirate logs you scan throughout the game specifically state that they just call it Metroid Prime, even though it has nothing to do with the Metroid species other than its ability to mutate them. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yet, its still not a metroid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prime 2 and 3 do not directly contradict information in Prime 1, and Prime 1 clearly states that Metroid Prime is not actually of the metroid species whatsoever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny, you didnt contradict a single thing I said. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is it you think youre arguing? #$%
@#$ $#@ machines don't qualify for species #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe it was a pussy planet like Pluto and a really big nuclear core. #$%
@#$ $#@ Atmospheric entry will cause things to hit the ground with a massive force, and it wasn't exactly a small space station #$%
@#$ $#@ Well no if its large enough then it will wipe out life on the planet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldn't the epm fucking purge you if he knew you worshiped a c'tan? #$%
@#$ $#@ If your space station is an artificial planetoid the size of the moon, maybe. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not the best but it's not even remotely bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except that Metroids can be cloned by humans with the help of human-designed computers, and yet humans dont know fucking bird magic. #$%
@#$ $#@ DNA is clearly a thing, even in a designed organism like the Metroid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure the burst makes no sense but the planet itself is dead, also I remeber there being a jungle during the opening cutscene from Fusion so where did you get the idea that the planet is a rock? #$%
@#$ $#@ You saw one part of the planet in Metroid 2, and even then you spent most of the game in a large network of caves did you not? #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why was there a jungle in Fusion? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what I was referring to. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series wrote itself into a corner when they eradicated the entire species and series namesake in the second game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Granted Prime series had fucking Metroids everywhere so at least some have to be out there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shitposters take advantage of any button they can push, to inflate their ego by claiming control over their victims #$%
@#$ $#@ are you me? #$%
@#$ $#@ and other m is just space pirate propaganda #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you touch yourself at night. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes them feel special, fills the void. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am literally going to consume your still living flesh. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how you imply Witcher 3 and Undertale are good and the people shitting on it are casuals. #$%
@#$ $#@ I blame the fruits who post frogs and use the word meme for everything #$%
@#$ $#@ This I love my vidya and have for over 20 years but games arnt made with love and care, or to be fun anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are made to make money and a huge amount of it is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are still good games but they are the minority now compared to products. #$%
@#$ $#@ The truth is that some people get their kicks just by bashing a game and reveling in the defense force that comes out to fill the thread, and then the people who genuinely dislike the game come in and bash the defenders, even if that person has never even actually played the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice gif #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, or they just have aspergers #$%
@#$ $#@ you have no idea what that means, nor does anyone else on this board #$%
@#$ $#@ spotted the aspie #$%
@#$ $#@ point proven #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats sad is the fun being a buzzword is being said unironically all over the place now. #$%
@#$ $#@ In a sense that anon was a psychic genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ Taking a nice shit is fun because of your prostate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its why anal play and toys are such a huge thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ 99% of it is sexual frustration. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really want to know what kind of shitty, boring life you live if you give up things that are fun because you cant find an objective reason for enjoying it. #$%
@#$ $#@ not as subjective as your mother was last night faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ lol stfu and settle down nerd #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice projecting, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has more to do with the fact that most people just suck at verbalizing their feelings and thoughts #$%
@#$ $#@ there is no way this isn't a shitpost #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ is underage and unable to accept that people have opinions different from their own. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's also why 90% of the time they can't tell you why a game is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Oh the music is bad and the gameplay is shit and it looks like garbage so it's bad" #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ No human with an IQ above 100 would enjoy things because they are fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Silly me. #$%
@#$ $#@ unless its to appease an annoying friend, why would you lie about having fun? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit is just a buzzword, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ does that word salad taste good? #$%
@#$ $#@ less of a buzzword than fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, type out an essay on why you enjoy ice cream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saying that it that its because of the taste is just a buzzword. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol its still shit faggot apply yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ no i didn't, and you haven't answered me either #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, this is the most stupid post I have ever seen on this board. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, you could come up with a scientific explanation routed in evolutionary biology on why someone likes sports, too, but its fucking stupid and pointless, and it makes it sound like you have homo acute aspergers. #$%
@#$ $#@ i can't even make sense of what you're trying to say anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ name a game for 2012 and later. #$%
@#$ $#@ the kind of people who use the unresolved word "fun" didn't find it fun on their own, they arrived their because it was popular #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally never said that. #$%
@#$ $#@ When arguing, you better damn well do better than food analogies. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is so wrong i don't even know how to respond #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd say about 11 years ago #$%
@#$ $#@ when arguing, you should stuff my cock in your mouth because you have absolutely nothing of value to contribute to this conversation. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off, charles #$%
@#$ $#@ So much mad in one post. #$%
@#$ $#@ why dont you present an actual argument then? #$%
@#$ $#@ thinking all fun comes from something being popular is such an incredibly stupid thing to think #$%
@#$ $#@ le u mad XD le trollface #$%
@#$ $#@ that's not what i wrote, there was attempt at responce i rate 2/10 #$%
@#$ $#@ okay you're just shitposting at this point #$%
@#$ $#@ I imagine finding someone to call you out on your retarded drivel wouldnt be too hard, why /v/ specifically, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ specifically no, your question was way to general, but on disk dlc is a thing you know #$%
@#$ $#@ I presented arguments, you stated you couldn't follow, i summarized for you, and you told me to present an argument, either your reading comprehension is your limiter, or you are the shitposter #$%
@#$ $#@ your arguments were beyond flawed, none of what you said is true in the slightest #$%
@#$ $#@ So does the word "description" not occur in your vocabulary at all, or are you too autistic to apply it in this conversation/context? #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ has the highest concentration of autists who use mental gymnastics to justify their arguments, and have an incredibly complex system of mental gymnastics set up in their head thats laws may change at will depending on whether or not it suits them in any given argument. #$%
@#$ $#@ What game today has 60% of it cut off and sold as dlc? #$%
@#$ $#@ People here [and in all of 4chan] have fun dont having fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ where did you say any of that? #$%
@#$ $#@ all i saw you say was that people who can't find a reason for something being fun automatically think that because of something with all social interactions being the same or whatever silly thing you said #$%
@#$ $#@ What he said made sense to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ You might just be retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes you would. #$%
@#$ $#@ be quiet #$%
@#$ $#@ Name a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ the monkey can LEARN? #$%
@#$ $#@ That just looks like a list of Korean MMO shovelware, which in this case wouldnt be a new enough phenomenon to justify your argument. #$%
@#$ $#@ ahaha yeah so cynical WHOA ahaha niiice i watch angry joe for all of the latest gaming news ahahaha niiice slick B #$%
@#$ $#@ and you accused me of shitposting, great job kid #$%
@#$ $#@ No youre not, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun is a buzzword, literally a boogeyman invented by reddit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is your butt literally bleeding right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ you told me to direct you to posts and i did and instead of continuing to argue your point you're just namecalling #$%
@#$ $#@ ;' you don't have to be mad man, just remember this next time you get blown the fuck out in an argument. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont even bother starting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hold on to hope that Larian will once again save me from mediocrity but I fear my expectations might get unreasonable as a result. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only talk about obscure games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every successful or AAA games are shat on here. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's no use talking about them because people don't know how to control themselves and be nuanced about games. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was sarcasm. #$%
@#$ $#@ i dunno, you could argue your point a little more, or something, probably #$%
@#$ $#@ because i think its funny to see how far he can go with his mental gymnastics until i break him and plant my seed into his fragile mind, forcing him to come back to this board every day to scream at me before he ultimately ends his life. #$%
@#$ $#@ i love making dumb faggots on /v/ miserable. #$%
@#$ $#@ that is my job. #$%
@#$ $#@ i do it for free. #$%
@#$ $#@ you claimed i didn't have any points, that's not a response that continues the dialouge #$%
@#$ $#@ You have no control over anything like that in your real life, let alone some random person who may or may not still be replying to you on an anonymous message board. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont cut yourself on all that edge. #$%
@#$ $#@ hes going to end his life. #$%
@#$ $#@ whatever floats your boat i guess #$%
@#$ $#@ why dont you argue yours then? #$%
@#$ $#@ i've been asking you to and you never did #$%
@#$ $#@ Find a game you enjoy and play it and fuck what a bunch of faggots think. #$%
@#$ $#@ im playing the star wars battlefront beta right now and loving it. #$%
@#$ $#@ i love it that it makes you dumb faggots on /v/ angry that i'm not jaded to the point where i can't subjectively enjoy everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ im laughing my ass off at you fucking queers and enjoying this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ later, i will go to bed and bang my hot korean wife. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just feel sorry for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ not pasta when its true. #$%
@#$ $#@ i'm playing on my huge flatscreen tv rn and loving every second of it while you faggots whine and piss your pants on /v/ #$%

@#$ $#@ make me #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not true when it's pasta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also stop pissing yourself there kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you actually think anyone has had any higher of a reaction than vague bemusement or slight air coming through their nose at anything youve ever said on here? #$%
@#$ $#@ You grossly overvalue the impact of your words. #$%
@#$ $#@ suck my ass, dickboy #$%
@#$ $#@ you only boasted about it to get reactions of envy, which you didn't get and now say you didn't want those reactions #$%
@#$ $#@ i know how jealous of me they are deep down. #$%
@#$ $#@ they play on a shitty monitor in their sweaty college dorm room. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would anyone be jealous of a faggot who types every sentence like theyre having an aneurysm and has an imaginary wife? #$%
@#$ $#@ you dumb niggers all type like you have schizophrenia when you type anything a paragraph+ in length, because your aspergers prevents you from formulating and articulating complex thoughts in an organized manner. #$%
@#$ $#@ my flat screen works just fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ i notice absolutely zero difference in performance than any of my other TVs, or any other tv/monitor I have used anywhere else. #$%
@#$ $#@ replace counter points with name calling #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn, you got boring quick. #$%
@#$ $#@ /po/ is much better at this than you. #$%
@#$ $#@ well, niggers, i gotta go. #$%
@#$ $#@ seo-yun is waiting. #$%
@#$ $#@ cant wait to get my dick wet. #$%
@#$ $#@ hope you faggots stop being lonely and grow out of this phase in your life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude how pathetic can you get? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just go to bed kid, youre clearly fanny flustered. #$%
@#$ $#@ just ignore him now #$%
@#$ $#@ even shitposters are getting worst #$%
@#$ $#@ its how people here trick themselves into thinking that they arn't getting older, and closer to death #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt imply that it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, see you tomorrow! #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, play 2 just to see how fuckin shitty it is and when you play 3 your gonna feel the cuhhrazy! #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play the game you flying faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ I planned on platinuming all three. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesn't seem too hard #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting all S Ranks in DMC1 on DMD is legit hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ literally the 1 cool moment in the game, thank you for sharing. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, no it didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing that giant sword just reminds me how shit the weapons are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Him devil triggering reminded me how shit devil trigger is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only cool moment in the game was him shooting the boss in the cutscene at the end of that fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ I personally had the most trouble with DMC3 out of them all #$%
@#$ $#@ Stupid shit that only 13 year olds can consider cool and repetitive gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're an idiot #$%
@#$ $#@ you can expect there to be 3 devil may cry games rofl #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you sure youre not in a DmC thread, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would I fight you, you clearly are me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nevan is a fun weapon #$%
@#$ $#@ clearly 13 #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC4se &gt; DMC3 &gt; DMC4 &gt; DMC1 &gt; DmCde &gt; DMC2 &gt; DmC #$%
@#$ $#@ you forgot about DMC3:SE FAGGOT #$%
@#$ $#@ did you die to cerberus #$%
@#$ $#@ it doesnt change the rankings, it would just go between 4se and 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC2, by far #$%
@#$ $#@ If the opening cutscene of DMC3 doesn't excite you in any way, then just save yourself some time and don't bother with the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the DMC2 outfit #$%
@#$ $#@ It's okay #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga I didnt even remotely consider gitting gud and I had no idea how until a few years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did anyone actually play as the girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant even remember her name. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should bring her back, shes underrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt mind that, she suffers from being in a bad game but could be good. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks nice and a double dagger style might be neat. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt OP owns an NES. #$%
@#$ $#@ If DMC2 was such shit, why did it sell much better than 1 and 3? #$%
@#$ $#@ nah feel free to skip 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone who has played any fighting game at any level above absolute basic knows about iframes. #$%
@#$ $#@ When did DmC get two sequels? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much, then DMC4 sound more then all the past ones because it was riding in on DMC3s hype. #$%
@#$ $#@ By that logic DmC should have outsold 4 but it was so clear it was shit that never happened. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they every did 5 Im not sure how it would go, if it would ride DmCs low hype or ride DMC4:SEs hype and sell more? #$%
@#$ $#@ there were tests comparing the combos etc you can do in each dmc. #$%
@#$ $#@ i remember dmc4 winning at combos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck if your not EU. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC2 bloody palace is a nightmare. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lucifer is female in some games #$%
@#$ $#@ Takes female form, Lucifer has no gender. #$%
@#$ $#@ What about Satan? #$%
@#$ $#@ atlus is terribly misogynistic for portraying such an evil being as a female, they're clearly supporting the patriarchy #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the titties that bother you and not the everything else? #$%
@#$ $#@ no, but it's a weird design #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT II has the weirdest alignment system. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much nothing you do before the alignment lock matters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if you play the whole game Law, you can get chaos if you tell David Bowie you like his ideas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Soooo are there any other weapons? #$%
@#$ $#@ why would you throw a perfectly good mag on the floor? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats his name again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its tacticool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking magnets. #$%
@#$ $#@ What is this exactly? #$%
@#$ $#@ Google doesnt say anything useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like warhammer vermintide #$%
@#$ $#@ COMMENCE TO JIGGLING #$%
@#$ $#@ What exactly is starcraft even about? #$%
@#$ $#@ They still know how to do cut-scenes #$%
@#$ $#@ i'm pretty sure theyve always outsourced the cgi cutscenes #$%
@#$ $#@ no-one knows #$%
@#$ $#@ JC2 wasn't challenging in the slightest and I sunk hundreds of hours into it #$%
@#$ $#@ Anons how do I into Blinkfusor? #$%
@#$ $#@ did this happen today? #$%
@#$ $#@ by using the dueling spin instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Blinks is blue #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, thats what one that is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can into Dueler, thnx anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this game alive again? #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS has always been dumb, but Twin Snakes really pushes it. #$%
@#$ $#@ mixed things? #$%
@#$ $#@ it's good imo just lacking content unlockable stuff if you compare it to other rogue-lite games what it does it does pretty damn well though it should work on any kind of flightstick/joystick setup as far as i know #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get the blinks either. #$%
@#$ $#@ But if you can get good its very easy to hit bps when you chase. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you just match speed and click. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of Descent #$%
@#$ $#@ wat mod, this is for SoC right? #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn I would stick my penis in her. #$%
@#$ $#@ sublevel zero #$%
@#$ $#@ take your gore over to /b/ please #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill never understand why this webm is out of order. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit, you can kill child soldiers in this game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this Star Wars fanfic bullshit really in the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ What gam #$%
@#$ $#@ For Snake? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something about the way his face moves is off putting, what is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pity the game is shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Such a waste of great art assets. #$%
@#$ $#@ What, just because hes black he looks off-putting? #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck man? #$%
@#$ $#@ What's going on here #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoyment of the whole game hinges on whether you enjoy the banter between the two characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you find them irritating as fuck, like I did, then the whole game is just a bland mediocre mess that ends with a slap in your face as it forces you to undo everything you accomplished to save an unlikeable bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive actually owned this game for a few years now and have never even touched it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you still do kick ass time rewind stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ Game has nothing to do with time travel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead the justification for recovering from falls is that any time you fall the stupid whiny bitch that follows you around the whole game magically flies down, grabs you and puts you back on the nearest platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ They also managed to actually make the combat even worse than the combat in the sands of time trilogy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't believe that the romans would fight in those clothes in such conditions #$%
@#$ $#@ not shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ why would I wanna play a game that has less features than previous entries in the series? #$%
@#$ $#@ lmao get outta here kid #$%
@#$ $#@ SO HERE I AM #$%
@#$ $#@ That game was basically a QTE without button prompts #$%
@#$ $#@ so is literally every game ever made #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, I need to get in on this Occulus Rift shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ you'd have to be baiting to imply that pop0 is anything other than one of the worst pop games #$%
@#$ $#@ What mod you using, friend? #$%
@#$ $#@ What was this called, Red Ninja? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why wasnt Dead Space a game about salvaging ships from the space zombies? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't believe I didn't notice that. #$%
@#$ $#@ because it's dull and uninteresting #$%
@#$ $#@ that actually sounds really cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Space Hulk but without the Space Marines #$%
@#$ $#@ high skill dark souls pvp #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ shits on Bethesda and Bioware for shitty animations, but gives this a pass? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen claymation that moved better. #$%
@#$ $#@ unexpected feels #$%
@#$ $#@ I need a PS4 #$%
@#$ $#@ What a time to be alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ That game is no longer in development, isnt it? #$%
@#$ $#@ I SHED THE BLOOD OF SAXON MEN #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is this so appealing to my eyes #$%
@#$ $#@ Hahaha holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish this game didn't suck dick, cause it's pretty to look at. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, the idea was pretty good, game was great at the start. #$%
@#$ $#@ But then they started releasing new weapons every few months and getting really pay2win. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean people with high skill will still kill people with low skill, but if 2 people have equal skill the one that bought the new OP weapons and exp boosts to rank faster will win. #$%
@#$ $#@ That and for the first year they shafter TR every update. #$%
@#$ $#@ Karma for all the years of HEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHE #$%
@#$ $#@ They admitted its dying? #$%
@#$ $#@ So why not just make shit easier to get? #$%
@#$ $#@ I REMEMBER THIS FUCKING MOD #$%
@#$ $#@ Better dying with honor, probabily. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because their logic is to squeeze dry what players are left. #$%
@#$ $#@ They actually INCREASED ingame-currency prices by 100-250%, ostensibly to make people buy more smedleyshekels, but as you might guess, it only made the game more P2W. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, theyre dying with a whimper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Based Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ it doesn't though lol #$%
@#$ $#@ Retards couldn't figure it out, that's why they ditched it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kind of enjoyed the simplicity of the old system, even if it was completely unrealistic and far too easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ congrats you described every bethesda game #$%
@#$ $#@ We've already seen it, It's exactly the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also so is hacking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oblivions was best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where was this taken, some kind of private screening or some shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ God I fucking hated hacking #$%
@#$ $#@ WHY IS THAT ABOMINATION STILL THERE. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gamescom, they showed some gameplay footage that hasnt been released yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre keeping it for conventions, like the EB Games convention in Sydney Australia just recently. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are they so secretive about the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah okay, thanks pal. #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw a webm of the laser musket but it was recorded with a cellphone so I was wondering why and how recent it was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bethesda don't want people to know it's shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats as close to hacking will be in a video game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate these stupid lockpicking minigames. #$%
@#$ $#@ I used auto attempt every time in Oblivion and Im pissed that went away in later games. #$%
@#$ $#@ the same reason star wars battlefield is going to be dead 2 weeks after release #$%
@#$ $#@ But it's a Bethesda game, so that's a given. #$%
@#$ $#@ You better watch what you say kiddo... #$%
@#$ $#@ more like easiest #$%
@#$ $#@ I would rather Thief Deadly Shadows lockpicking at this point. #$%
@#$ $#@ who cares, its /vg/ #$%
@#$ $#@ And /v/ has no right looking down on other boards. #$%
@#$ $#@ they do if the other board is /vg/ #$%
@#$ $#@ heavily surprised they arent borrowing this from Wolfenstein TNO like they are with destructible environments and armors. #$%
@#$ $#@ What was New Orders lock-picking mechanic? #$%
@#$ $#@ depends really on what i want to do, i very rarely use shotgun breach. #$%
@#$ $#@ i mostly use lockpicking with a recon and have someone cover the door #$%
@#$ $#@ This sums up most AAA games prerelease. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best thing would be using an arcade stick with literal force feedback. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega unconventional but I think it could be lulzy #$%
@#$ $#@ Still the first thing Im modding out, that and an alternate start. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's sad that it has gotten to the point where it's impossible to tell if this is a joke or not. #$%
@#$ $#@ they also showed the same stuff at quakecon. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I didn't know any better, I'd assume this picture was from Fallout 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ They even re-used the same fucking lock assets, holy shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off, todd #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you seen the first trailers? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fallout 4 is literally a reskinned 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the same, as is the hacking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty disappointing neither got any reworks at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are "fine" but they are just fucking boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ lockpicking in a modern setting is unrealistic to begin with so no real reason to try and go for pseudo-realism #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? #$%
@#$ $#@ I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Video Game Marketing and Salesmanship, and I’ve been involved in numerous promotional campaigns with retailers, and I have over 3,000,000 confirmed pre-orders. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am trained in agressive marketing and I’m the top promoter in the entire open world game industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are nothing to me but just another customer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will wipe your resistance to purchasing the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. #$%
@#$ $#@ You think you can get away with saying that shit about my game over the Internet? #$%
@#$ $#@ Think again, fucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ As we speak I am contacting my secret network of analytics data across the USA and your Google search and Amazon purchase preferences are being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your wallet. #$%
@#$ $#@ You’r savings are fucking dead, kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can make you buy my game anywhere, anytime, and I can serve it to you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with digital distribution services. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not only am I extensively trained in psychology, but I have access to the entire budget of Zenimax and I will use it to its full extent to fill your miserable ass Steam Library, you little shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ If only you could have known what holy gameplay your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have opened your fucking wallet. #$%
@#$ $#@ But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you valued customer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will shit Fallout 4 ™ all over you and you will drown in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You’re fucking buying it, kiddo. #$%
@#$ $#@ I understood how they wanted it to work but it made zero fucking sense when actually doing it, how does it work? #$%
@#$ $#@ It seemed to be completely random even though I tried matching it with similar words with similar letters all the damn time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe my science wasnt high enough so my percentage of getting the right word even though it was very similar but I donno. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank god, that shit looks stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks even easier than 3/nv. #$%
@#$ $#@ What game was it where you could break locks by hitting them Instead of using lockpicking? #$%
@#$ $#@ Was it morrowind? #$%
@#$ $#@ I had fergus route #$%
@#$ $#@ Splinter Cell #$%
@#$ $#@ You can use {}[] and other random text to get new options, from the start. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its very dull, and after 50 hours you just want that shit to be over with. #$%
@#$ $#@ probably played 3 and NV for at least 5-600 hours and never knew this #$%
@#$ $#@ ALONE APART #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre pretty contained as far as power levels go. #$%
@#$ $#@ They start strong but dont get a whole lot stronger as far as power levels go. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre strong in a combat sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Vampire's defense against them comes in the form of their minions and their ability to manipulate the shit out of them #$%
@#$ $#@ This thread has been here for the last 3 days. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you the one who posted it every time? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or did you mean that particular gif? #$%
@#$ $#@ wheres the fem PC /u/ stuff /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ The first time I saw this thread I posted that with the text #$%
@#$ $#@ Because they were originally just an excuse for the vampires to congregate in the cities. #$%
@#$ $#@ VtM 1st edition was released before WtA was even conceived, and the "lupines" were just a background retard antagonist NPC race. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the same reason why Lasombra and Tzimisce have such loosely defined powers, because they were originally were intended for NPCs only. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, but no Garou is a match for an antediluvian, and one must remember that theyre not immortal and will die of old age anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem with the Malkavian run is that if youre able to read between the lines and/or correctly interpret your own dialogue choices, there are potentially major spoilers for the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well the thing with antediluvians is their rank 10 discipline is literally 'plot device' which means they can do whatever they need to do with it #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah man, there's really not much a garou can do against any of the original few gens of vamps, there's never really been anything to deny that, either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well exactly, thats a good thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ It simulates the malkavian madness network. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like you ONLY get relevant info, you can speculate but nothing's confirmed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Point is, its purely theoretical. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please go yiff somewhere else. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is akin to "BUT WHAT IF CAIN EMBRACED ANOTHER 2ND GEN?!" #$%
@#$ $#@ My first run was a Malk and I had no trouble following what was going on, except for that taxi ride at the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone loves Lucina #$%
@#$ $#@ It's another way of asking who will step in and calm the emotional aggressor down so he doesn't have to fight when he absolutely has no reason to fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know you know this already OP, but there is a reason why this is regarded as the worst Final Fantasy released. #$%
@#$ $#@ I found XIII more offensive than Other M. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other M was pretty bad, but its no Federation Force. #$%
@#$ $#@ federation force is not even out yet, and I bet at the very least it will be better than other M #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy Type 0 HD was a far bigger disappointment. #$%
@#$ $#@ I went into Type 0 expecting Kingdom Hearts with a shit ton of characters and war and politics themes ala FFXII. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other M being what it was doesnt impact the quality of the previous games and future FF games are still going to be poisoned by forcing Lightning in them one way or another. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry, it'll get better once you get back to the linear area. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked 3's story because it was self-contained, and didn't need to rely on the other games for support. #$%
@#$ $#@ The story itself was enjoyable in a cheesy Bond movie-esque sort of way. #$%
@#$ $#@ FFXIII is an actually fantastic game as long as you dont mind linearity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although the opening seems awfully similar to FFVIIs opening in ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fast-paced action opening starting out with a character getting out of a train. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will assume you never played FF14 not-"a realm reborn". #$%
@#$ $#@ People like you make my head hurt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please stop. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the nignog character. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck do you find XIIIs gameplay fun? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was expexting 12 gameplay with better story telling. #$%
@#$ $#@ All i got was bull shit #$%
@#$ $#@ So youre entertained by the flashy animations even though the gameplay has the depth of a puddle in the sahara desert? #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes me wonder how far they got before they switched from rabbits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, why rabbits? #$%
@#$ $#@ That actually doesnt look that bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of Sleeping Dogs #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus dick we dodged a bullet #$%
@#$ $#@ Dat Wright-style Layton. #$%
@#$ $#@ probably something that changed during development when they were still searching for a character, ink--x Rabbits --&gt; squids --&gt; inklings #$%
@#$ $#@ Those animation for green hair on the lower corner are actually really cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hope this design gets used on some new character one day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something about the white fur letting the paint stand out on them, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ aw man, imagine all the furry porn we wouldve had by now? #$%
@#$ $#@ good point, but these guys don't got the booty #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish they wouldve implemented the idea of Cole changing clothes based on karma instead of his shirt and pants changing color. #$%
@#$ $#@ An hero immediately #$%
@#$ $#@ i miss klonoa #$%
@#$ $#@ I need this book! #$%
@#$ $#@ Top left are the best #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder who that cute girl would have been. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit that is way too fucking hot. #$%
@#$ $#@ japan only so far ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ The one on the left almost looks like something that could have replaced Riptor in Killer Instinct. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would kill for a 3DS game, a finish on the comic series, something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Huh, for some reason thats making me wish Galaxy had a level inside of a castle that would have M.C. #$%
@#$ $#@ Escher stairs on the inside or something...even though thats really not what that concept art is trying to suggest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a ton of great DKC:Returns concept art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too much to dump for me, but this is my favorite one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shauna was made to drain semen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally, I like this one the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon that was in the actual game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell I think it shows up again in Tropical Freeze. #$%
@#$ $#@ The retro DK statue does show up, I know, but I still like that picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ The concept arts style is a lot different from the end game too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like a King of Fighters character #$%
@#$ $#@ The girl on the bottom right? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a concept for Athena, she had a good bunch of them #$%
@#$ $#@ It really is kinda lame how he never really changed clothing at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially if you go good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think in Infamous 1 absolutely nothing changes at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ is there one for snake man? #$%
@#$ $#@ Drawings dont have the limits that games do. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he gets all pale and shit if you go evil. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I got are ones for 9 and 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Subject Delta and his Hack tool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last one on the 3rd row is legit badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno if it would fit the personality they gave Juri at all, but I love the design. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks like she kicks ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ And a black splotch on the head as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think there's much of any concept art for pre-MM9 Robot Masters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like they only started saving the stuff recently. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked their original outfits better. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the turrets were designed. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of Chill Man's concepts look better than how he turned out in the end, so I guess that's a plus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Elizabeths Design. #$%
@#$ $#@ This looks better than anything Genzoman has ever shit out. #$%
@#$ $#@ More Elizabeth designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally all of those Eschas are better than the one we ended up with. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the Vigors were designed. #$%
@#$ $#@ He has fuel tanks for shoulders. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny seeing concept art for Elizabeth vs concept art of female characters for Japanese games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Infinite had such good designs, too bad it didnt make up for the gameplay and story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something something lion heart #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this Ojamajo Doremi? #$%
@#$ $#@ I have more Concept art coming from this series, so watch out anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ And everyones favorite robot waifu. #$%
@#$ $#@ But wait! #$%
@#$ $#@ A challenger appears from the depths of development hell! #$%
@#$ $#@ Let's take a break from Infinite and look at BioShock 1 &amp; 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ What would you pick instead /v/? #$%
@#$ $#@ More Big Daddies. #$%
@#$ $#@ More honey woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does this reminds me of Arkham Bane? #$%
@#$ $#@ This design is unique enough to be its own character. #$%
@#$ $#@ was this really a kids game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Big Sister. #$%
@#$ $#@ He looks like fucking Chandler Bing #$%
@#$ $#@ I really liked her design. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you played the DLC Minervas Den, then you pretty much know what Concept is this. #$%
@#$ $#@ IT STILL HURTS #$%
@#$ $#@ why shinji a gril? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets move on to Splicers. #$%
@#$ $#@ that isn't Nadia #$%
@#$ $#@ Brute Splicer #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you mean Miss Chanandler Bong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spider Splicer, with bonus close-up on Deltas arm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of Bionicle. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually have the Megaman Complete works art book. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of this stuff is from that, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think thats from Epic Mickey. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Lutece twins. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats actually an early Battletoads design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Finally a motor patriot. #$%
@#$ $#@ theres still something really weird yet charming about disney and ff being in the same world of KH1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad KH2 killed that atmosphere #$%
@#$ $#@ More Splicers #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember when Infamous 2 was first showing screen shots, cole had hair and the reaction wasnt great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did somebody say...Boys of Silence? #$%
@#$ $#@ lmao what a neckbeard #$%
@#$ $#@ More concept. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh shit is there a new one out #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta love artists with a sense of humor #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm already a demon #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think I'll post much Sonic 1 concept art. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think most people have seen it already but there is some obscure stuff #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats metal as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shauna is LITERALLY sex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck yeah, you are speaking my language. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanx m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like Kirigiri actually was first one dead in alpha and leon was still murderer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never good for him... #$%
@#$ $#@ concept animations #$%
@#$ $#@ This is supposed to be Metal Sonic. #$%
@#$ $#@ This too #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont forget that some of the assets for the level were apparently reused for one of the levels in Spinball. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at those fucking lips #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Mecha Sonic, whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant top the Mecha Sonic from Sonic 3K. #$%
@#$ $#@ waluigi for smash when #$%
@#$ $#@ Mario got owned lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ And of course, cant forget this gem. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember seeing this one before, but I thought it was just a fanmade thing #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda looks like ricstar #$%
@#$ $#@ Ristar, what happened to you?! #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah man thats so cool! #$%
@#$ $#@ Sucks we never got it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looked like a Whomps Fortress type level. #$%
@#$ $#@ and finally this one #$%
@#$ $#@ I really dont understand whats going on with Amy Roses dress. #$%
@#$ $#@ It changes shape in every other drawing until the late 2000s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Always bugged me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont care what folks think about the game, but Metroid Prime had some God Tier Concept art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lost World concept art with Classic Sonic in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makes you wonder. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like his design got separated into two characters, Flameman.exe and Mistman.exe #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn Olimar has some hips on him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've always liked the concept of crystals growing out of people #$%
@#$ $#@ reminds me of p2 intro #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah they kinda had to tone it down because it had underage kids killing each other. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's also the reason why the blood is pink #$%
@#$ $#@ Whos this from or would have been? #$%
@#$ $#@ No concept art for Phoebe, or any other gym leaders? #$%
@#$ $#@ i want this in HD #$%
@#$ $#@ check the persona general on /vg/, they have download links for artbooks in the OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that Pierce together with Yosuke? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mutated concept of pic related from Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those clothes really shout out Sion from The Bouncer. #$%
@#$ $#@ He really was Proto-Sora. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's kinda cool tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ SONIC ACTUALLY DOES HAVE BLUE ARMS!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ dat humanoid bunny girl #$%
@#$ $#@ I know #$%
@#$ $#@ more humans in the concept for sonic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Including his gf Madonna. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know tfw, fam #$%
@#$ $#@ daisyfags pls go #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how even they had to figure out how the hell that hair works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit we need that pufferfish in the game stat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats crazy is she ended up getting used in the comics lately, just like Honey. #$%
@#$ $#@ SoA thought it was creepy. #$%
@#$ $#@ that looks really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did they go with those dumbass sushi hats instead of headbands? #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems like Tierno does the same thing as most of us do #$%
@#$ $#@ bottom right is definitely the best design, according to my dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Togami looks like he's from the CIA #$%
@#$ $#@ On the bright side we got Punch-Out Wii because this was canned #$%
@#$ $#@ Man all the logys look good. #$%
@#$ $#@ that looks fucking rad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im glad they SOME of that presentation shined through in Strikers, but fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine that now on the Wii U. #$%
@#$ $#@ On the other hand, they were pretty stupid wasting dev time trying to get this approved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, cmon man. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is pitching this stupid, they already made something for them #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a straight ripoff of a mario galaxy 2 level. #$%
@#$ $#@ The one where you balance on the ball and roll through #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it's Nintendo you're trying to get it approved from. #$%
@#$ $#@ They protect Marios image harder than Disney does Mickey Mouse--just look at those new shorts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Trying to get a Mario design that exposes all his bare skin was also a dumb idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thatd never happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds a bit redundant since they put him and his friends in fur suits. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK NINTENDO #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not sure I follow #$%
@#$ $#@ looks like something from moomin #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate superpowers #$%
@#$ $#@ WOW I am glad they didnt ruin her with that fucking Braid #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed, it seems so much more realistic too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck those kids and Eli. #$%
@#$ $#@ DECIDE THE DESTINY #$%
@#$ $#@ LET'S ROCK #$%
@#$ $#@ Large Leader shouldve took them and train them in soldiers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rebel 1 #$%
@#$ $#@ The best thing to come from this game was this line of dialogue. #$%
@#$ $#@ DEATH COMES RIDING ON A MIDNIGHT TRAIN #$%
@#$ $#@ Any child dying ever, even if not by your hands, is an instant game over. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure, if you hack the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can cqc them and throw them into walls and shit, is that good enough? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just imagine that scene with player agency involved. #$%
@#$ $#@ The camera slowly moves behind Big Boss and the hud fades in. #$%
@#$ $#@ It resumes normal gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wanted recording of the gunshots. #$%
@#$ $#@ To make the player think he shot the kids. #$%
@#$ $#@ The two options were to bring them to Outer Heaven, or live them to live through hell, and he said theres another option which is to kill them. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's a meme you dip #$%
@#$ $#@ ironic shitposting is still shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ It does happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ After that everyone, including BB, have a diamond on their uniform. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would have been nice to trigger a scene on motherbase of the soldiers stitching their new blinged emblems to their uniforms or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ What guarantees theyd go to heaven though? #$%
@#$ $#@ They might have believed in the wrong religion, or maybe religion isnt true in the MGS universe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I recommend the mod of not playing the game lol #$%
@#$ $#@ na, I'll return to arpgs with actual gameplay like dark souls and monster hunter #$%
@#$ $#@ whats wrong with monster hunter? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty rude. #$%
@#$ $#@ at least I don't play games with shit gameplay like vampire the masquerade #$%
@#$ $#@ I like fun video games lol, not the worst of all worlds "video game" movie book things #$%
@#$ $#@ give this man recon #$%
@#$ $#@ wow, nice dude! #$%
@#$ $#@ i don't think i will ever do it lol #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't own any platforms/games with achievements #$%
@#$ $#@ If theyre using the traditional Halo 2 saving system then it would be completely down to RNG, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ All I remember is anger and jackels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I supposed to be impressed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea, but if helioskrill is any indication itll be in reqs as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will just be rare as fuck legendary permanent and probably the last armor most people get from gold packs #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up, Vlad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep in mind that the MCC was broken for months after its release. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember trying to play multiplayer a month after release and it would still take upwards of 10-15 minutes just to find a match, and even then youd get un-even teams and massive lag. #$%
@#$ $#@ The whole thing was a massive joke, to the point where we got a port of ODST for free. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish MS would include some alternative to Sonys Platinums. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU ARE THE ONE COMING AT ME WITH YOUR "XBONESUCKSxd" FAGGOT #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking phone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let me correct that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have a weapon but it isnt visible on the screen nor is the icon used to aim. #$%
@#$ $#@ EPIC REPLY BRO YOU SURE ARE A WINNER #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but Im having fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ You gotta mix it up, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game gives you a million toys to play with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play with them. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shit is great for just fucking around. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doing shit just to do it is a blast, like trying to take out an entire outpost with just decoys or strictly using D-Dog and his stun baton and stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ STOP ENJOYING THINGS YOU FAGS #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit how? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck the online achievements #$%
@#$ $#@ Well done fam, think I saw you posting your 99% completion before #$%
@#$ $#@ So you only 100% bad games? #$%
@#$ $#@ mah nigga, one of the few games i got all the achievements for #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt really hard mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hardest achievement in there is the 100 games one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did I insult you? #$%
@#$ $#@ If I did im sorry but all of those games on there are bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ an xbot asking for attention #$%
@#$ $#@ What are games that you like then, my fellow shit poster. #$%
@#$ $#@ Achievement Locked: Get a life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a rather ironic thing to hear on 4chans /v/ board. #$%
@#$ $#@ For starters, disable Trophy/Achievement notifications. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youll never 100% IRL because the Lose Your Virginity achievement will always be locked. #$%
@#$ $#@ One day you just realize its a waste of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I live with my gf, she both loves vidya and my dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet your love hers too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Congrats on your total waste of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm fine with her feminine dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Literal degeneracy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if I were him, does that change my argument at all? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it make you any more competent? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you think youre clever in any way? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you think you are, mister Freud? #$%
@#$ $#@ Were on an achievement thread on /v/, who cares about your psychology 101? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want you to know you will always be less intelligent and less successful than me in life. #$%
@#$ $#@ why cant e-celeb posters get banned on site already? #$%
@#$ $#@ The instant youtube existed #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you trying to prove with this post? #$%
@#$ $#@ is that supposed to be a dig at someone or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, me too. #$%
@#$ $#@ well it is a complete playthrough of dark souls with commentary. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not like a review or critique or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Key differences mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ DSII video was a critique, this is a commentary; him just playing the game and commenting on shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ A critique is something actively criticizing. #$%
@#$ $#@ A commentary is just making comments on shit negative, positive, whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh you mean like superbunnyhop did? #$%
@#$ $#@ Says the lazy fatass yelling Feed Me! #$%
@#$ $#@ Le badly drawn drunkard is much less fun than stunted hamster #$%
@#$ $#@ I got bored with his commentary after 3 hours. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish he wouldnt waste his time explaining unrelated stuff like what pre-fetching is and how RAM is faster than harddrives, culling and shit like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was my anime of the season. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disagree on the prefetching part considering how Dark Souls loads its world is an improvement in every single way over Demons Souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ People who care about video games? #$%
@#$ $#@ the very minute they became "a thing" #$%
@#$ $#@ One is an enemy the other is a meme #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does /v/ love this guy so much? #$%
@#$ $#@ i do #$%
@#$ $#@ Well yeah, he should mention it but he went on too long trying to explain how it works etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone knows what streaming is already. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a comfy overanalyzing irishman who rambles about things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because everyone but you is a 12 year old mentally retarded american who is too stupid for real games like early 2000 mass marketed pc games unlike us, so they go on youtube and give money to the Israeli jews and have their wives get fucked by niggers, just so you'd have a worse day #$%
@#$ $#@ Those kind of threads are thiny veiled off topic threads anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you and your /v/ culture. #$%
@#$ $#@ We need a /youtube/ board #$%
@#$ $#@ This mentality is what's ruined multiple boards on 4chan, go kill yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ I sort of think as /v/ as an "Anything can be discussed if its vidya" sort of deal as even Retro games can be discussed on /v/ if people arent assholes about it before /vr/ was a thing, but it really feels like discussion of any kind of videogame automatically redirects you to another board when this is the general all-videogame topic board. #$%
@#$ $#@ We need a /vc/ board, videogame celebrities. #$%
@#$ $#@ There you can talk about videogame developers, e celebs, youtubers, twitch streamers, gossip, twitter caps and SJW shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Purge that shit out of /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Truth is, /vr/ and /vg/ is where youdiscuss vidya, /v/ is the real containment board for shitposters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone thought that an /lgbt/ board was a good idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ E-celeb containment sounds really tame in comparison. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh please. #$%
@#$ $#@ /vg/ is more about community circlejerks than video games and /vr/ is about as alive as the consoles it discusses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, youre really pissed off over something becoming popular. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either a board or a general on /vg/. #$%
@#$ $#@ That shit has nothing to do with /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont talk about videogames, they talk about celebrities that play videogames just to go into off topic arguments. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, rules about generals should be applied, but not when my favourite fashion of the moment videogame is involved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also Blazblue #$%
@#$ $#@ People realized that wanting to put your dick in a horse vagina doesnt make you superior to furries just because a girls head is sticking out the neck. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're all retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ cry more faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Retarded because people want generals out of /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe you are the retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ post yours #$%
@#$ $#@ post yours faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Needs icons, but I guess it's alright #$%

@#$ $#@ Thanks man #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't see how it's edgy but okay #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you make that assumption? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly the Fight Club quote. #$%
@#$ $#@ Palahniuk is the edgy M. #$%
@#$ $#@ Night Shamalan of literature. #$%
@#$ $#@ The background doesnt help either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except thats wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh the quote changes every day #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course I read. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not a philistine. #$%

@#$ $#@ Of course you can find plenty of other shit thats actually fucked up or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wealthy but not rich and my country goes to great lengths to support socially retarded people. #$%

@#$ $#@ Shut the fuck up #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks for supporting me, wagecuck! #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice wallpapers, especially Nui #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a fine opinion to have on /g/, not /v/ where windows is needed for vidya. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least we have games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre on /v/ what are you expecting people to have? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's ok #$%
@#$ $#@ clear out your notifications jesus christ #$%

@#$ $#@ Thanks for the wallpaper idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ I needed something halloween. #$%
@#$ $#@ ten ir id eygr #$%
@#$ $#@ 10/10 tbqfh to be quite fucking honest #$%
@#$ $#@ A labryinth of folders to make it seem as though it is mundane files. #$%
@#$ $#@ what's in it #$%
@#$ $#@ Some shit's gotta be encrypted and kept offline if you know what I'm saying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unforgivable porn, cant you read? #$%
@#$ $#@ what is it #$%
@#$ $#@ No te preocupes, yo no uso de ellos, los tengo allí por la falta de motivación que tengo en la eliminación de ellos #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a bunch of folders with text files I moved from games and what not, .ini files and that sort of thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also have a single red herring folder with normie porn in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuff youd fine on redtube or youporn or what have you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just incase someone gets curious. #$%
@#$ $#@ who wont forgive you #$%
@#$ $#@ Always go a few steps beyond the red herring. #$%
@#$ $#@ They always look just a bit further. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your Spanish sucks fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Estaba usando google traductor para que los que no entiendan español lo puedan traducir y entenderlo ahora me pregunto porque no ocupe ingles en el primer lugar #$%
@#$ $#@ i forgive you #$%
@#$ $#@ How did you get custom tiles on Win10? #$%
@#$ $#@ memefrog is for my sister btw #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a weird and convoluted way to be considerate #$%
@#$ $#@ Unreleased version of OblyTile. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will give you that although there is still a lot of PS2 games that have a whole heap of problems when it comes to trying to emulate them which is a joke considering who old the PS2 is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Emulation is good when it works but it doesnt work nearly as good as it should or how others tell you it will. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't even get me started on downloading the iso's either. #$%
@#$ $#@ I need to change this wallpaper sometime soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh man, I like freight trains. #$%
@#$ $#@ You shouldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ PC is great if you dont care about Japanese developers and only want to play games made by indie teams and western devs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not even being sarcastic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japs have always made the best games and you wont be playing any of them on PC unless it is through emulation, complete lack of variety compared to consoles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool thing, bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks doc #$%
@#$ $#@ kill yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the free you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yo, how do you center your shit on the taskbar? #$%

@#$ $#@ Ill check them out if I cant figure out above anons idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ i realize this isnt your real desktop but it still gave me cancer #$%

@#$ $#@ Why are there black borders? #$%
@#$ $#@ Stalker is really great, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love that scene with the dog and the dude lying down. #$%

@#$ $#@ Yea, I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wanted to play it one last time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not HD but sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty minimal. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the Wallpaper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, right click on taskbar, properties, tick use small taskbar buttons #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, no #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit love that Persona 4 calendar #$%
@#$ $#@ besides posting, your desktop is not bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe hide the taskbar and get a minimal rainmeter clock and it should look nicer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im really fucking OCD with how my taskbar is sorted. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know if it makes any sense to anybody but my fucked up OCD brain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Internet right there feels right maan #$%
@#$ $#@ You CHEEKY CUNT #$%
@#$ $#@ How does a pleb like me go about getting some of these fancy widgets, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont be tricked, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre useless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally do nothing but slow your computer down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even /g/ or /wg/ like them, they're trash, don't bother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right, actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are unnecessarily large. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again, Im just too lazy to do something that means fucking with Explorer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate having icons looks too messy for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ u can see her bush #$%
@#$ $#@ that's a plus #$%
@#$ $#@ also I haven't cleaned away unnecessary icons and shit yet, I just got the thing recently #$%
@#$ $#@ that is clearly 7 #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like you're either the type of person who is TOO into weebshit, or you're like my one friend who was only interested in animes with sexual undertones and characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 7. #$%
@#$ $#@ you don't have to respond or anything #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats pretty cool bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got no shame can't be tamed #$%

@#$ $#@ yeah man these FUCKING NORMIES and their cars like REEEE get out xD #$%
@#$ $#@ clean version plis #$%
@#$ $#@ sure thing hombre #$%
@#$ $#@ Best in the thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ if this wasn't a 5-hour old post I'd upload my copy of RemoveWAT for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sucks to be you I guess #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks m8, I had to dig through so much shit to find one that wasn't awful #$%
@#$ $#@ this is bait #$%
@#$ $#@ You never know when you need to access your fonts. #$%
@#$ $#@ And they say the highways in murica are huge, it must suck balls in china to make a right or left turn in the clusterfuck of roads. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do the blue cars represent? #$%
@#$ $#@ depressed white people #$%
@#$ $#@ frogger by platinum #$%
@#$ $#@ Some Chinese traffic jam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but why is it here and why does the braindead faggot OP think you have to fill out every field? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, but thats not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ IV is such a step backwards from III that its not funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ IV has no other characters, adds no new items, no good powerups, the controls are too easy, the game itself is very easy, it has no branching paths so even less replayability, it has maybe three good songs, the graphics are ugly, the framerate is passable at best and unplayable at worst, and the eight directional whip makes things easier still. #$%
@#$ $#@ New Generation feels like an actual Castlevania game. #$%
@#$ $#@ New Generation has two characters, branching paths, new powerups, a super powerup, great music for every level, a reasonable difficulty curve, real challenge, limited continues, and cooler boss battles. #$%
@#$ $#@ New Generation is way better than IV. #$%
@#$ $#@ SF3 was pretty awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the few PS I had that I liked. #$%
@#$ $#@ *PS games #$%
@#$ $#@ I never liked this series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had the first one and another on the Saturn and could never get into them like I did with the original series. #$%
@#$ $#@ The N64 games were actually pretty great imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ The LoS games arent even worth my time are they? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not unless you like cutscenes, QTEs, and none of the elements that made Castlevania good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have to admit... #$%
@#$ $#@ This is pretty damn accurate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Soundtrack should have it's place in this image too, it's fucking great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre all good, but IV is very easy and has a lot of technical issues. #$%
@#$ $#@ rg plz go #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have brain damage? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes right, tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ Camera isnt great thanks to lolN64 and the controls are a bit stiff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise they were really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brought some nice ideas to the series and the Villa is one of my favorite stages of the entire series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was only focusing on their RTSs #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with them? #$%
@#$ $#@ But you have WoW and hearthstone on there #$%
@#$ $#@ Hello fellow Sokubro #$%
@#$ $#@ I still dont understand why the N64 version is the only one that lets you mix 2 powers together. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its the best game in the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont get me wrong, 4 had a LOT of problems, but I liked components of it much more than 5, at least 4 felt finished. #$%
@#$ $#@ the only one I played was 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought this series was shit all-around. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're telling me i'm wrong? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are there 3 different versions of GT5? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why dont you like super? #$%
@#$ $#@ but yeah, Ghouls n Ghosts is definitely the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is kind of neat, it would be a lot better if it didnt have the Silent Hill name attached to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know a lot of people dislike it but I enjoy it for trying something a little different. #$%
@#$ $#@ It isnt very scary unfortunately. #$%
@#$ $#@ It came out on every console imaginable including PS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you like CV2 over CV4? #$%
@#$ $#@ Framerate issues really bugged me, it made it almost unplayable. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was probably burnt out on the series when I played it, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ II is pretty good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the PS2 version removes some of the slowdowns. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you rate the NES game good then? #$%
@#$ $#@ The framerate was complete shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent played that one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the original cart and the Wii U VC release, which is exactly the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ It had a better framerate than Super, and it didnt have the double jump. #$%
@#$ $#@ The translation patch for 2 is god tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ CV4 is bad, just like the console its on, you Amerifat manchild. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dracula X is honestly a pretty good CV game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even though it's a stripped down Rondo of Blood, it's better than CV1 and SCIV at bare minimum and feels MUCH more like a classic CV game than SCIV does. #$%
@#$ $#@ whatever fedoramaster #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Snes is for fedoras, as it is a kiddy console with RPGs and it was only popular in America and Japan. #$%
@#$ $#@ BR detected. #$%
@#$ $#@ its decent, just not as good as the others. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Australian. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Snes was frowned upon here, and in the UK, to my knowledge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo is for fedoras and babies. #$%
@#$ $#@ But its not popular, it sold like shit here, you stupid Amerifat. #$%
@#$ $#@ It sold likeshit in Iraq too, the point is your literally who console market doesnt matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ It matters to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont give a shit about your market from your shit country that has produced no great games. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not the exact same game as sc1 #$%
@#$ $#@ Except the best SNES games were japanese. #$%
@#$ $#@ And im not even american you dumbfuck kangaroo. #$%
@#$ $#@ I lived in the UK from 87 until 91, maybe you were a kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of my mates kids had a SNES. #$%
@#$ $#@ For adults and teenagers everyone had a PC or MD. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is a bad game, but you didnt have to shit post like an actual redditor when they get their feelings hurt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not a bad game, kiddo. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats fucking WRONG. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Great Britain had nothing but Commodore 64 until PC got popular in the mid 90s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you even born then? #$%
@#$ $#@ You really dont know shit, do you? #$%
@#$ $#@ You aren't alone, it's mediocre at best for Castlevania standards. #$%
@#$ $#@ SGnG has shitty slowdowns in whatever version you play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ here is your reply #$%
@#$ $#@ I could be, but you may not know it yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad I'm not the only one who enjoyed Tourist Trophy #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot about DJ Hero. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, he didnt play the Dreamcast version and he found the PS1 version to be better than the N64 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ The N64 copy that I had had sound quality issues. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes the music would cut off at random, or not load up at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sound effects wouldnt play either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also lack of VA, but thats more of a pet peeve. #$%
@#$ $#@ RIP Blizzard #$%
@#$ $#@ Megaman Legends had better textures and draw distance on PS1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im glad that the general consensus is Seasons surpasses Ages. #$%
@#$ $#@ order of ecclesia is the best castlevania game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey kids! #$%
@#$ $#@ Can YOU spot the moment when Team Silent stopped working on the series? #$%
@#$ $#@ The first two Warcraft games may be better than you remember. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if I'd say Downpour was terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a pretty comfy game, but not a good Silent Hill game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Source sure was a lot of fun, but I think that it was more of a screw around game rather than a real competitive game. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats better? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit tastes #$%
@#$ $#@ Here's your reply #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong? #$%
@#$ $#@ What was so bad about sarges war? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow aren't you contrarian as fuck well done m8 I bet you get all your opinions from neo/v/ and youtube well done son you did it 8/8 you got two fishes with one stone on one line using a bird you little fuckboi congratulations #$%
@#$ $#@ Found someone that likes the Sf games as much as me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really enjoyed Dragon Quarter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where the fuck is Ride? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well done GB/NES music gets my dick harder than a prosthetic leg. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre so cynical you only like 6 games in the entire fanchise? #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck do you like re:coded more than KH2 based on the reaction but not 358/2 days? #$%
@#$ $#@ Off yourself you stupid fucking bastard, MGS 4s gameplay was normieized but not as much as MGS 5 and at least it had a story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering you enjoy Simons Quest and didnt orgasm for IV im calling you a troll #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you! #$%
@#$ $#@ Im so glad someone else hated FFX. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone else on /v/ seems to suck its dick, even though it has all of the problems XIII has except with a better battle system. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ultra pleb #$%
@#$ $#@ I love you, too bad i never played the ps2 games #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you a nigger? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think SC2 is better than 1 in every way except for the writing #$%
@#$ $#@ i played peace walker on an emulator with a keyboard, whats the problem? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you just grew out of them man. #$%
@#$ $#@ im glad im not to the only one who remebers the rush series #$%
@#$ $#@ wow you have shit taste if you dont love mario 64 and how old are you and why make a mario template if you havent play most of them? #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCKING WEEBS THESE GAMES LITERALLY ALL LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME #$%
@#$ $#@ Dunno, MM64 looked blurry as hell IMO, the textures in the PS1 version were cleaner, and the jaggies werent that bad on a CRT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention the muffled as hell sound/music #$%
@#$ $#@ PAL is better if the game was optimised for it, like most games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does Halo 1 give you a foreverially delitized bologna tongue? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Curse of darkness #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the cow #$%
@#$ $#@ The one that says perfect, as something cannot be better than perfect if it isnt called Curtis Axel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was 20 when I went over in 88. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there anything better than perfect? #$%
@#$ $#@ I can agree with this. #$%
@#$ $#@ 10 was just as shitty as 13 and fuck anyone who tries to defend it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I personally would have given a much lower rating to 8. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do they all have minimalistic covers except Sonic &amp; the Lost World? #$%
@#$ $#@ Also you like a lot of shitty games. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was also Neversofts Spider-Man, but for that, there were also Dreamcast and PC versions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately, having owned it on PS1 and hearing about the N64 version secondhand, I never got to play those versions, so I dont know if anything was improved other than the graphics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its too boring and narrative driven for me with nothing else interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre a weird one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Chaos Rising fix the moba shit gameplay? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really, just felt a bit better to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still need to play RE:make,0,Survivor,CHRONICLES and Revelations 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ order of ecclesia is the best castlevania game, why do you have such shit taste? #$%
@#$ $#@ They're all the same shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm going to update it as I finish it homie #$%
@#$ $#@ here is your reply #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably a series by some artist who at the time of the image's creation hadn't done a cover for Lost World. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry i can see why #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't burned out because I didn't bother with the shit ones like symphony of the night, as influential as it was, any of the gba castlevanias aside from circle of the moon, and any of the ds castlevanias aside from order of ecclesia. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've only played the original castlevania, rondo of blood, dracula x chronicles, circle of the moon, and order of ecclesia, all the other castlevanias might as well not even exist #$%
@#$ $#@ It took me a while to actually have the mainline SMT games click, but when it clicked, it clicked hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even know why. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing about the franchise seems especially unique, but I really enjoy it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Im missing something. #$%
@#$ $#@ How so? #$%
@#$ $#@ Please dont be a kid who thinks Zelda II is bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats some generous praise. #$%
@#$ $#@ i only played sf1, might check out 2 now #$%
@#$ $#@ Touch controls. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to repeat the same dungeon over and over again, it controls poorly, the sailing is boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because SMT is the only long running JRPG franchise that hasnt gone to shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Atlus knows exactly what people like about SMT and Persona too I guess and they just stick with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Four Sword Adventures was kind of an odd game for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember liking a few parts in it like the Village of the Blue Maiden and the revisit to Hyrule Castle with all the spooky added, but the rest seemed like tedious puzzle solving and necessary gem collecting. #$%
@#$ $#@ And its extreme linearity and lack of world exploration was kind of an weird formula for a Zelda game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant say I have the fondest memories of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your blank face reaction explains it pretty well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why dont you take a loaded gun and put it to your head. #$%
@#$ $#@ then pull the trigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark Souls 2 was shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get over it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id put the cautious smirk with the elongated neck for Layton vs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Phoenix because it was alright but also really fucking weird. #$%
@#$ $#@ What was wrong with 3D? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you hate X for no good reason other than following the meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate X because it has really bad stage design that overuses bottomless pits, has one of the worst final bosses in the franchise, and exists for no reason other than to ape off the success of a much better game in the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lords of Shadow 1 and 2 are really good games, just not good Castlevania games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Combat is very satisfying and I really liked the story. #$%
@#$ $#@ never played Mirror of Fate though #$%
@#$ $#@ Very poor taste #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the template, bub. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like you #$%
@#$ $#@ Here is your You #$%
@#$ $#@ Twilight princess is Not inferior to Whiny Wigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ That childs game had a unique style of open world but it was a shitload of pointless sailing which would have severely stunted it if removed. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you refuse to understand intelligence then At least put them at the same level. #$%
@#$ $#@ But your current opnion is ignored based on mental handicap. #$%
@#$ $#@ 1 2 and 3 are a little off, but youre spot on with everything else #$%
@#$ $#@ go to bed metzen #$%
@#$ $#@ what do you mean by that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes probably too young... #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, just story stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont really notice that shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ PSP ones are still legit best shooters on the system. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would also say Dark Mirror was better then Logans Shadow that had the best story of the two, and less gimmicks. #$%
@#$ $#@ But LS had tighter controls. #$%
@#$ $#@ I made this chart and pic related #$%
@#$ $#@ I can recall the PS version had actual cut scenes during certain points in the game while the N64s version used readable text in comic book like format. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aria of Sorrow was second best u nerd #$%
@#$ $#@ the reason 10 was good is because its combat system was great, it had somewhat great characters, and had a pretty decent story i guess, which is far more than what i can say for 13, the only thing i liked about 13 was Sazh and the baby chocobo :D #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Egoraptor was very, very critical of OoT and liked LBW a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3D World is so much fun, just wish I had friends to play co-op with ;_; .No online either, t-thanks Nintendo #$%
@#$ $#@ WW and Spirit Tracks both sucked, though, that doesnt make PH good. #$%
@#$ $#@ misinterpreting the facial expressions of other people is a symptom of literal autism #$%
@#$ $#@ just wait #$%
@#$ $#@ Why no Super Metroid? #$%
@#$ $#@ I found WW boring, tedious, and unmemorable. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a real slog to get through the last two dungeons. #$%
@#$ $#@ i recently played Harmony of dissonance as my first castlevania, loved it, but as everything starts getting to the end, the bosses start becoming more and more shit, until the final bosses are completely piss- easy, lets no talk about the endings, i bleeded acid tru the eyes, did something happen during development or all castlevanias are fun only for the exploration and end terribly? #$%
@#$ $#@ How does 3 and its greatest hits version differ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dreamcast had the best Rayman 2 version tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Master System is objectively worst. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still pretty ok console. #$%
@#$ $#@ savor it, the end sucks #$%
@#$ $#@ He's right though it's shit, the levelling system was hilariously bad Grinding? #$%
@#$ $#@ In MY Mega Man game? #$%
@#$ $#@ and had wayyyy to much focus on its crap story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt modern generations exactly the same as the daytime in unleashed? #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember it fondly, everyone had one growing up. #$%
@#$ $#@ same thing with conviction, somehow i put almost 70 hours in it and went through the campaign and coop campaign multiple times, only went through blacklist once with everything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was fun but with vast improvements but conviction was just more fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Was a good series, still haven't played origins though good rating #$%
@#$ $#@ ay, whats with that face on Windwaker? #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried to like it but couldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ My daycare let us emulate one of these when I was a little kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funniest fucking thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a way to play any of these now, and which one should I try? #$%
@#$ $#@ 0 looks so fucking rad, I really wanna play as Majima soooo bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its so good, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it doesnt get localized, import it, seriously its worth it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like 2 all over again, so silky smooth and more arcadey then ever before, and it feels damn good to use Majima that isnt in a zombie shooter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant tell if troll or fucking retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is so fucking spot-on. #$%
@#$ $#@ I take it someone doesn't like getting Ultima in KHFM #$%
@#$ $#@ It was more based on the stuff added on the Final Mix version really wasn't that great, other than the unknown boss #$%
@#$ $#@ no, it was unplayable shit, and killed the franchise, and nobody should like it EVER #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit taste #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny cause SH0 is much of a Silent Hill game than The Room. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you would really enjoy Revelations. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm very surprised it's not on your list #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon's cow is pretty well drawn #$%
@#$ $#@ what about the educational games #$%
@#$ $#@ Play Peace Walker HD, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is accurate #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe I shouldnt have replayed it 5 times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rather them go back to the old format. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like this except for the mgs 4 story part #$%
@#$ $#@ B/W 2 is like B/W 1 but better #$%
@#$ $#@ you get it #$%
@#$ $#@ Not shitting on your tastes, man, but I loved downpour after playing a shitfest like home coming, I feel people are a little harsh on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Downpour may not be the best game in the series but its leagues better than Homecoming. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats with the shitty self insert OC? #$%
@#$ $#@ i literally said half the game was unfun #$%
@#$ $#@ It could certainly do a lot worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, outside of the length of the tutorial, the amount of switching back and forth between human and wolf, the rupees being put back into the chest if its a value higher than 10 and you have a wallet full, nothing to spend your rupees on yet showering you with rupees, Magic Armor being worthless outside of throwing away rupees, the bloomy brown aesthetic, and the final wallet only unlocking literally one dungeon from the end of the game the game was alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ The areas were enjoyable enough, the music was good, the slashing while running was fantastic, Goron variation was nice, the weight of everything was just rightEspecially when you got sucked into a magnetic pull using the Iron Boots, and the dungeons were all great in their own ways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because I have some hangups over little things that doesnt make the entire game awful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Overall the experience was good, but certain little things brought down the experience. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ball and Chain had some uses outside of its dungeon, specifically fighting Stalfos, Stalchildren, and Redeads. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was amazing for Redeads since they died in two spins or one throw. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it also did something to Darknuts but I could be wrong, I personally didnt try using it on them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking this. #$%
@#$ $#@ When people first started making references to memes in daily life in the late 2000s I thought I was going to have aneurism from cringing so hard all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got something to confess, fam? #$%
@#$ $#@ smh tbh, why white "people" always so mad, chill #$%
@#$ $#@ Worse is when people unironically call them "maymays". #$%
@#$ $#@ And the fact most of 4chan now takes memes from tumblr and facebook to respost isntead of tumblr, reddit, and facebook reposting 4chan memes #$%
@#$ $#@ damn nigga chill #$%
@#$ $#@ It's like it's summertime all the time! #$%
@#$ $#@ The times have changed old man #$%
@#$ $#@ i fucking hate people who "parrot" other peoples opinions. #$%
@#$ $#@ might as well sew your mouths up their asses #$%
@#$ $#@ That was a magazine, not a catchall term for people who played games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not really mad about the word gamer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, it could be game-player, or lord-master. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I dont like is people referring themselves as that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont care if you like Minecraft, Starcraft, Dota, Mario, Street Fighter, Metal Gear, Smash Bros, or shit like Candy Crush or Farmville. #$%
@#$ $#@ People that use those terms to identity with have a bigger problem than what games they play. #$%
@#$ $#@ Exactly, Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's something seriously wrong with people that can't like or dislike something without having another person point out to them as to why they should feel that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people just need that external validation I suppose. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive never seen any of things u mentioned outside of online , sjw, movie buffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I network all the time nd havent talked to people that think like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other people call me an athlete but im also an artist nd i dont care nd neither does any1 else #$%
@#$ $#@ i acknowledge my shortcomings. #$%
@#$ $#@ no sarcasm mind you. #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you for pointing out my mistakes as i am simply trying to learn the ways in here. #$%
@#$ $#@ anonymous opinions are so interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ i also wish to kill myself #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, yes and no. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're feeding into the belief that MOBAs and e-cancer should exist, but you're doing it for your sake, for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm more talking about people that would rather watch YT and pick up someone's opinion than experience it for themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually I draw a bit too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing gets me angrier than when people tell me that I should pursue it as a career. #$%
@#$ $#@ It all stops at the same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ People seek outwards for happiness when they should just look inside themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ All these boards on 4chan focus on a distraction from the outside world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even one of them is about stopping to look within. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess society is just doomed to never find themselves until their midlife crisis happens and they realize that the happiness the world wanted for them isnt the one they wanted themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ well, to be fair they were joking when they said this so i may have misinterpreted something. #$%
@#$ $#@ the picture was the first thing i saw after searching "cringe gaming" on google. #$%
@#$ $#@ i apologize anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck man, my friends do this all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ What makes it even more annoying is the fact that they all have the means to play these games PCs, consoles, and money yet they refuse to play anything besides FIFA 15 and CS:GO. #$%
@#$ $#@ stop apologizing nigger, man up #$%
@#$ $#@ pokemon is easy as hell to master #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do you give a rats ass? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm trying to understand who the guy in the first video is addressing..help me out here #$%
@#$ $#@ you know what? #$%
@#$ $#@ i think your opinion is shit and will continue to argue that the trash meme i posted is great. #$%
@#$ $#@ im sorry anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still remember when YOLO became a thing and one of my friends went out and bought a shirt that said YOLO on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ He now has diabetes and a kid with a girl who fucks other dudes on the side. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking irony mate, I love it #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, you are dating an internet meme, you should marry her quick before you realize it's all in your head #$%
@#$ $#@ not as shit as my 1 though #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt he vomiting blood during every single mission? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sunny's into that #$%
@#$ $#@ she can now, Naomi taught her #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she looks like her mother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes a master chef when it comes to spaghetti. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually girls that begin growing their boobs young "peak early" and end up being barely a Bcup #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeha but Sunny lives in Kojimaland SO D-cup ahoy. #$%
@#$ $#@ She got off the plane and went full Olga. #$%
@#$ $#@ They grow up so fast... #$%
@#$ $#@ If he fucks her shell die. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of those women he fucks on the weekends must die too. #$%
@#$ $#@ keep telling yourself that #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, it really is a blemish on an otherwise outstanding series with amazing lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ocelot dies in 2014 bruh #$%
@#$ $#@ She's fucking George #$%
@#$ $#@ Hals already busy banging women at clubs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Confirmed years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop crying. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still haven't found good Olga porn and she's been around since 2001. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I want to lick that armpit I'm not even into that fetish #$%
@#$ $#@ There's no good porn of any MGS girls it's all gay shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its time to move onto a new fetish if you really wish to enjoy mgs porn that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ and this is a bad thing how? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanted to throw up as soon as she lifted her arms #$%
@#$ $#@ I only like boys who look like girls #$%
@#$ $#@ But shes best girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not? #$%
@#$ $#@ He already fucked his stepmom, his stepsister wanted to fuck him and he already cheated on Snake. #$%
@#$ $#@ How so? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, he did fake a heart attack only a few cutscenes before that #$%
@#$ $#@ Otacon fucked genetics bimbo despite already raising a child together with Snake #$%
@#$ $#@ had a hard life #$%
@#$ $#@ Along with the biggest fan of James Bond, a black guy who dreams about a metal gear made of shit, a dude with a hard on for loading revolvers, a blonde chink , and a guy who believes on Santa #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit I never realized the graphics were this bad, what the fuck is that 1998 civilization intro cutscene? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a dude, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ man that guy looks EXACTLY like an italian/Indonesian guy i know #$%
@#$ $#@ Your wife also put on 140 pounds after she married you. #$%
@#$ $#@ You seem offended somehow. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sorry I offended you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please do not be upset. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, I'm just trying to suggest that fat girl tits don't count. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sure your wife is a lovely woman. #$%
@#$ $#@ You seem like youre the one offended here, honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Regardless, saying that EVERY girl who starts early dont get very large breasts is stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to think that they gave a cyborg body to snake but he no longers appear because his story endend so he is alive but not mentioned or seen #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it seems pretty pointless to let him die when they have the technology to keep disembodied brains alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda funny knowing the most normal of them all was the only black guy in the group. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also rather than Santa I'd say Snake's inappropriate attachment to cardboard boxes in his standout trait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes not his dad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Women come into his life and die on their own all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ You sounds really mad m8, holy shit... #$%
@#$ $#@ not really. #$%
@#$ $#@ stop acting retarded though. #$%
@#$ $#@ this tbqfhwy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent cried since I was 12 years old. #$%
@#$ $#@ How can someone who cries even call themselves an adult? #$%
@#$ $#@ i cried when i played undertale actually i never had that kind of feeling playing a video game elsewhere #$%
@#$ $#@ I heard about some girl streamer crying after she killed toriel but I havent actually seen the video. #$%
@#$ $#@ well you gotta if you want dat pacifist ending, nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ So is lisa actually good? #$%
@#$ $#@ I had written it off as pretentious indie trash along with undertale, but then I actually played undertale and it was good so I dont know what to think anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Toby is trying to show you the inherently violent way gamers interact with games. #$%
@#$ $#@ He gives you the option to spare her, but he knows youll just assume that you have to beat her up in order to spare her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Undertale literally has taught me more than any class or experience in my life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Undertale makes you peer deep into your soul, but beware, you may not like what you see! #$%
@#$ $#@ lisa is alot more ruthless in terms of difficulty #$%
@#$ $#@ I do like it when games are more subtle with their emotion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games like Dark Souls, for instance, actually succeed in focusing on gameplay, but still manage to leave an emotional impact by atmosphere alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how video games should be. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games like undertale where they emulate some shitty soap opera and try to appeal to emotion are overtly faggy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know why you are mad, but I seriously hope the Undertale fanbase get some improvement to not turn into something like the Sonic fanbase. #$%
@#$ $#@ perfect Engrish. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know time zones and stuff, but youre 3 hours early by 4chan time so Id assume thats why. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always wondered about producers who made it big in 2-3 albums, like Wowaka. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess you get all that dosh and say Fuck it, Im good. #$%
@#$ $#@ ....and here are the two of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aw yeah sweet future Rin brah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive always assumed gumi being an only child, mind linking me some favorite songs you have of her? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, I meant to say Android Gumi was made by the same guy who made CUL, Gakupo, and Lily. #$%
@#$ $#@ This must be the cutest Vocaloid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I do like all the songs of his on the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I guess, kinda hurts #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does arifureta remind me of that one game where you shoot portals and do shit with it? #$%
@#$ $#@ It feels like singing miku is actually the crazy robot bitch while robot miku is the test subject #$%
@#$ $#@ "Citation needed" #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for letting me know #$%
@#$ $#@ Preachin' to the choir #$%
@#$ $#@ Used to go to /a/ a few months back, watching them implode got tiresome after awhile #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe now she can be in Project Mirai. #$%
@#$ $#@ mirai series is dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ No its not #$%
@#$ $#@ I kind of hope it is #$%
@#$ $#@ good because it really is #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not all three #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, there's so many garbage threads on /v/, we really didn't think anyone would notice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like Touhou. #$%

@#$ $#@ I'm surprised she doesn't like it already. #$%

@#$ $#@ would the books get someone into the music? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it would be better to find a song that she isn't familiar with, she might not like a vocaloid cover since it's different than the original #$%
@#$ $#@ No plus, managed to get it anyway due to plus on my regular account. #$%
@#$ $#@ how was it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think anyone that comes to these threads regularly thinks they are still "alive and well" #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant marry Music Synthesising Software, silly anon! #$%
@#$ $#@ Samfree died? #$%
@#$ $#@ When did that happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill believe you when this oppressive shitlord captcha gets taken down and bots and bot-kin can once more post on 4chan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont forget PowapowaP either. #$%
@#$ $#@ He died in July!? #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus Christ, we need some sort of producer cemetery or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres some limited gameplay out right now if you search War of Rights on YouTube, but more is being shown on the 15th. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there any games that take place in America in this era? #$%
@#$ $#@ Good ones, I mean. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, there is the Mount and Blade, North and South Mod. #$%
@#$ $#@ People do historical events on that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not necessarily talking entirely war-based, just in America in that era. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lucky for you, people really dont give a shit in games like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a ridiculous assumption, I mean fuck, I thought /v/ was one of the most committed groups of people to the idea that video games are one of the most unbiased and honest forms of media. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know of anything like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best I can give you is either the multiplayer North and South mod, or a single player gunpowder mod for Mount and Blade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im thinking more of Napoleonic Warfare, and less of Fire and Sword, but a bit more free form from Napoleonic Wars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except FaS wasnt made for linebattles. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to linebattle, get the Napoleonic Wars DLC #$%
@#$ $#@ That is equally awful #$%
@#$ $#@ The thing is that people need to understand that just because they lost, doesnt mean they should be portrayed any differently than how they were in combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ They almost won #$%
@#$ $#@ With the industrial revolution around the corner, slaves would have been done away with anyway, but the thing that you need to remember the most is that it should have been the states decision to abolish it, not some federal fucks up in Washington who have no idea how different culture is in each state. #$%
@#$ $#@ A universal rulebook doesnt work everywhere, and we as a nation still suffer because of that today. #$%
@#$ $#@ They may have won many battles and almost won several others, losing at times to sheer luck, but there was never actually a chance of the South "winning" the Civil War. #$%
@#$ $#@ The North could always throw more men and money at it than the South could ever hope to produce, and the blockade was also ridiculously effective. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not entirely true. #$%
@#$ $#@ If wars were black and white and purely attrition based, then yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the South came pretty close to breaking the Union populations will to continue several times. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they had ever taken DC they probably could have gotten a white peace. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at how our nation is in shambles, how our government intrudes on every aspect of our lives, how it takes a cut of everything we have, and spends it on ludicrous things that benefit no one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disagree with slavery, but the federal government has no business running the affairs of citizens, it goes against the constitution itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good, fuck you, we don't need quitters, we need people who recognize it's shit and want to rebuild. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt think it would get this bad when I made it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit guys... #$%
@#$ $#@ Take this to /pol/ #$%
@#$ $#@ So the social decay and lack of morals we have in this country is what you consider to be good? #$%
@#$ $#@ Free States of America, if I recall. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is literally called War of Rights #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuckin please asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ The industrial revolution was decades away from hitting the south because they didnt have the infrastructure for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention fucking southern goods were fueling the industrial revolution in the north. #$%
@#$ $#@ The south read white, slave-owning aristocrats that were the only ones who could vote was not going to change because it was so deep seeded in their culture paternalism, etc that even AFTER they ran out of land to expand slavery, meaning that the souths days were numbered, they still insisted on ridiculous demands like giving all the expansionist territories to them and relegalizing slave trading in the capitol and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone that says states right or war of northern aggression is a fucking idiot that hasnt read a single credible source on the subject. #$%
@#$ $#@ the exact same argument you're using right now was used to justify segregation #$%
@#$ $#@ And not only that, the South killed twice as many soldiers as the North. #$%
@#$ $#@ North literally just threw men at the south until it died. #$%
@#$ $#@ By no means was it a graceful victory. #$%
@#$ $#@ my state government is just as shit if not worse than the federal government, you have no idea what you're talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ I completely got my shit slapped by the FSA since pretty much all my industry was in the states that seceded #$%
@#$ $#@ Scholars generally agree the South came close to winning during Lee's Maryland Campaign and that throughout the war there are 4 major turning points where it could have ended the war differently: Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, and I can't remember last one. #$%
@#$ $#@ The South did almost win and thats not an exaggeration. #$%
@#$ $#@ It took Sherman to commit literal war crimes in order to defeat the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck the North. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not sure I agree with that, the thing you need to remember is that vicksburg surrendered on the same day the union won at gettysburg, meaning even if Lee had won there he still would have lost the whole western half of the CSA. #$%
@#$ $#@ He decided to invade the north instead of breaking that siege, but even if his gamble had paid off Im really not sure it would have been enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like he could have just walked into a city like Baltimore or Washington, they had very significant defenses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mississippi and Alabama dont have culture. #$%
@#$ $#@ Descendant of a Cherokee Brave here, We here in Oklahoma side with the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ if the south was willing to do the same maybe they would have won :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ Howre those Syrian refugees treating you, Abdullah? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shows an obvious Moral difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most Northerners didnt give a fuck about Slavery until they started portraying it as super evil. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slavery was abolished last in the North you know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not only that, but Blacks were still treated like dogshit in the north. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Lee broke the Army of the Potomac he very well could have walked right into Washington, Philadelphia, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were literally Lincolns lifeline in the border states. #$%
@#$ $#@ With all the draft riots, if The North lost decisively at Gettysburg there wasn't a shot in helk he could've mustered another army to stop Lee. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whether that would've ended the war, I don't know but it would've put the North back on the defense which would've in turn sold southern superiority to the europeans looking to back the South. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cheyenne here, and Im with the south aswell. #$%
@#$ $#@ My battle brother, I stand with you my red ally, as I stand with the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ This basically, when England abolished slavery they compensated all the slave owners for each slave that was set free, both the people and the government. #$%
@#$ $#@ But in America we decided to kill the shit out of us and burn the living fuck out of the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ I too would be enraged if Islam had finally reached my borders en masse despite the crusades. #$%
@#$ $#@ all the money went to reconstruction #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres more natives that stand with the south than people think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its good to see another native bro on here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Mobile a lot when I was there, Miami and Austin are nice too. #$%
@#$ $#@ not him, but I have been told by my mother that my Great Grandfather on her side and Great Grandmother on my Fathers side were both full blood native, Im too cheap to pay for an actual test, but Im still white and my last name is irish. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont give a fuck, but I respect the natives and side with the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah you can make fun all you like, but in 200 years the coming European race war will make some fucking sweet video games and still no one will give a shit about the American civil war. #$%
@#$ $#@ Asshurt southerners are the funniest things ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ &gt;WAAAAAH THEY CHEATED THEY COMMITED WAR CRIMES WAAAAAAAAH #$%
@#$ $#@ Presumably well if he's actually named Abdullah #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck me delayed posting is a bitch can't even shitpost properly #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course he got away, pipes are garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should have used bolt actions. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, this is fucking painful, the jap takes over and everything goes to shit #$%
@#$ $#@ The Warcrimes commit by Sherman make Slavery in the south look like Candy Land in comparison. #$%
@#$ $#@ The North likes to pretend they were a morally just good, all the while, slaughtering their countrymen of the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly dont know what I would do if the site shut down I actually like discussing video games here and on /vg/. #$%
@#$ $#@ reddit is garbage and I can't go back to old forums anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ the game is called War of Rights, which means it is acknowledging States Rights as a point of issue. #$%
@#$ $#@ it isn't called "War of Treason" or "War of Slavery" - I expect it to be sympathetic to the South #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you celebrating a group of people worse than the Nazis with this offensive game and offensive flag, shitlord? #$%
@#$ $#@ You call this defending history? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is history that should be forgotten. #$%
@#$ $#@ there is a good ww1 game, its called valiant hearts #$%
@#$ $#@ UK was willing to support the south in order to make the US weaker and at the same time they would patrol the seas in order to free slaves. #$%
@#$ $#@ In geopolitics moral and ideology never come first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I think the motivations of the rank and file was certainly noble, defending ones homeland is not a black or white issue after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it, what's funny about what I said? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what public schooling gets you. #$%
@#$ $#@ The mod they made had a foreign intervention faction. #$%
@#$ $#@ Intervention faction? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like a "what if" situation. #$%
@#$ $#@ What about foreign troops that served both sides? #$%
@#$ $#@ Miamis not a southern city, only northern Florida counts as the south, southern Florida honestly has more in common with California. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Mobile and Austin are quite nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats that brown thing the 2nd and 4th soldiers are wearing? #$%
@#$ $#@ A rolled up blanket. #$%
@#$ $#@ A sleeping mat or a blanket. #$%
@#$ $#@ The mod they made for mount and blade warband let you play as all sorts of regiments from different states and even preachers. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's just how yanks are, I don't even argue with them anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eventually well all come to blows again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even white, and I know what side of the conflict Id be, because. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like many others have said, the civil war was not 'strictly' about race or slavery. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's still free #$%
@#$ $#@ pub games on the mod are pretty dead but its still fun if you can get a game with a few people. #$%
@#$ $#@ American schooling really is terrible. #$%
@#$ $#@ I grew up in the South and we were still, mostly, fed that crap about us being the bad guys of the Civil War. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only started to learn about history when I graduated and started doing my own research. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you pirate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ No I got it off moddb this summer #$%
@#$ $#@ After reading this thread, and several other threads on the site over years where anything Southern comes up, I feel like watching that documentary should be required before even talking about it in a thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it is extremely good, almost perfect. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is pretty good, only at the start of the program narator tells which people and groups funded it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, prepare a bit of time just to watch one episode. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is a tad long. #$%
@#$ $#@ Extremely accurate. #$%
@#$ $#@ And also the most unbiased documentary about the Civil War Ive seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant recommend it enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont let the age put you off, its not like weve had any major historical discoveries since then that changed how we look at the war. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im made of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ FARK I want to march to dixie and shoot shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ In game of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, youre a pretty big faggot you backwoods cousinfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, after watching you will have an undeniable urge to listen to Dixie and other catchy songs from the era. #$%
@#$ $#@ You might even cry, it shows how terrible the war was. #$%
@#$ $#@ In American history the war is never taught well enough to make an emotional connection. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd be surprised how different rural California is from the big cities. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stay mad cuck, Southern nationalism is on the rise again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also enjoy Trump getting elected, making this country great again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bernie votin yank spotted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every other nation in the world ended up outlawing slavery without a civil war - could you accept the possibility that slavery might of ended peacefully and with less resentment if it hadnt been done by killing millions of people but just by waiting a few years? #$%
@#$ $#@ Which part of what I said was incorrect? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm from northern Florida and I actually live in southern California now, and you're absolutely right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should have specified that the larger towns in southern Florida have more in common with the larger towns in southern California. #$%
@#$ $#@ nice b8 i r8 it an 8/8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Apart from your statement being complete bullshit on moral grounds, there was no plan in place before the start of the war to abolish slavery in the south. #$%
@#$ $#@ When it comes to historical discussion "X did nothing wrong" is a meme and you know it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even worthy of response. #$%
@#$ $#@ The CSA had just as much of a right to secede from the US as the US had the right to secede from Great Britain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Peaceful secession was allowed, however, the feds instigated the conflict at Fort Sumter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slavery is considered bad, among other things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit I thought I was the only Arkansasfag here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im around Jonesboro. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've talked to several ARfags here through the years but yeah we are few and far between #$%
@#$ $#@ They are the only one who had such a stupid civil war #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like "The Constitution" or "The Bill of Rights" always refers to the american one. #$%
@#$ $#@ who ever implied that? #$%
@#$ $#@ No we dont. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre on an American website. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saying "Civil war" here is obviously going to imply the American Civil War. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mexico had one even more stupid first #$%
@#$ $#@ NaS was the best mod ever for triggering butthurt southerners. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could throw any shitty bait and theyd lap it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ read the thread, the first person who got triggered was a southern /pol/tard #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Southerners may have been slavers but they werent fucking devils, like people portray them to be. #$%
@#$ $#@ The whole shit about that group of coons trying to dig up a southern generals grave pissed me off #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hope youre pretending to be retarded, and not actually arguing FOR slavery in 2015. #$%
@#$ $#@ It most definitely will. #$%
@#$ $#@ And i cant wait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its gonna be hilarious #$%
@#$ $#@ a civil war era musket could be reloaded in 15 seconds by a well trained soldier #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, dont be a faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can keep your heritage all you want, but dont try and pretend that keeping other humans as property was somehow not abominable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of your heritage isn't even related to slavery in the first place, it's you guys that insist on making a big deal out of it every time these discussions come up. #$%
@#$ $#@ you can argue morality all you want though Im not sure why the side that was seceding over the right for states to legislate on slavery would want to look at things from a moral perspective, but ok at the end of the day all that matters is if you have the strength to hold your clay. #$%
@#$ $#@ The south didn't and that's all there is to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Things would have gone much better for them had they not fought a war that was doomed to certain failure from the start. #$%
@#$ $#@ The federal government at the time was not going after any of the southern state's rights, they just reached butthurt critical mass because they kept losing out on new territories gaining slave status ironic considering it wasn't their fucking business what happened outside of their own state in the first place, m-muh state rights They finally lost it when yet another northerner who wasn't sympathetic to their "plight" even though Lincoln didn't give a shit about slaves or their rights got elected yet again. #$%
@#$ $#@ The grand fucking irony of the whole thing is, as you losers keep complaining about federal interference, the process of federal mingling would never have started if you dumb shits hadnt decided to throw your fit and slam the door on your way out. #$%
@#$ $#@ That would be the easiest way to kill any interest in the game for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also i like the idea of taking Abraham Lincolns background wrestler and making him a giant beefy dude who powerbombs entire armies to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Itll be like world of tanks but with people. #$%
@#$ $#@ 10/10 idea would buy #$%
@#$ $#@ Or you know, tha rights of man, one of which is freedom, the opposite of slavery. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would totally buy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were not taking those religious extremists back, deal with it redskin. #$%
@#$ $#@ History is always written by the victors. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean come on Abraham Lincoln is usually viewed as our greatest president and he turned the north into cannon fodder until he won. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4chan always is politically contrarian based on murrican politics. #$%
@#$ $#@ When bush was in the seat, everyone was liberals discussing ways to end corruption and fight the 1%, which in turn spawned that dumb occupy movement, chanology and leak culture, all things the average anon now takes distance from because daddy /pol/ would spank them again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its amazing how sensitive eurofags are. #$%
@#$ $#@ They honestly can not handle talking about another culture and always go on the defense. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear you fags have some kind of inferiority complex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Civil War was about states rights. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly the right to own slaves, but some other stuff too probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just a throwaway joke. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact remains that anon is contrarian to politics in the US. #$%
@#$ $#@ If republicans wins this election, you can be sure to see a surge of left wing arguements within a couple of years after, especially so if the elected does a poor job. #$%
@#$ $#@ For a website that loves the nazis so much, I'm surprised there aren't more statists. #$%
@#$ $#@ Totalitarianism was the ultimate form of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not what statism is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Statism is the belief that the central government should have control over the nation's economic and social policies, it doesn't inherently have anything to do with might makes right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell a statist institution doesnt even have to be authoritarian, it can be minarchism. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even close. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Union was committing a tenth of what they could have to the Civil War. #$%
@#$ $#@ The South never had a chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, but it still attracts undesirable people across the world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not everyone who likes punk is automatically a shitty subhuman, but many subhumans like punk. #$%
@#$ $#@ How in the ever living fuck are any of the battles in this game ever turn into proper line battles. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's just no fucking way it's going to happen unless there's AI on the map that forms ranks and follows some kind of commander's orders. #$%
@#$ $#@ player groups do the small scale stuff like formations and volley fire just fine in NW and the other musket based stuff for M&amp;B. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you mean proper as in tactics and numbers of men involved I agree that its kind of underwhelming and not exactly realistic but its probably the best youll get with individual players being soldiers. #$%
@#$ $#@ meme some more bro, meme it up #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst MGS game #$%
@#$ $#@ Those that didnt rike it really should off themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was adorable. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's Naked Snake tho fam :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ Para-Medic droning on and on about movies didn't entice me, I never felt the need to talk to Sigint, and Major Zero just ain't no Colonel Campbell. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually hated MGS4 until I recently replayed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never talked to sigint either lol #$%
@#$ $#@ How does it connect to the Psycho Mantis in MGS1 though, who is basically a completely different person? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is he the third child? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why isnt he best bros with Liquid in MGS? #$%
@#$ $#@ None of it actually has any context or makes any sense, whatsoever. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS2 is an undisputed masterpiece, so ahead of its time it only becomes more relevant as the years go on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or do you think its a clusterfuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ She was mentioned. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the Huey tapes explained why ParaMedic was called a male in MGS1 #$%
@#$ $#@ I got a little excited for a sec when Ocelot mentioned them, thought wed finally get her first name. #$%
@#$ $#@ But nope, he just mentioned stuff I already knew. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've already talked about why I don't like MGS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the social commentary part of it, I think it had a lot to say and ironically enough some elements of the conveyed message are left up to player interpretation. #$%
@#$ $#@ However, I dislike the game as a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Big Shell was a huge step down from Shadow Moses. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bosses were boring, both to fight and personality-wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even though Raiden is meant to be a surrogate, he annoyed me and Rose annoyed me three times as much as him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Running around the Big Shell pepper spraying bombs wasnt fun, and neither was escorting Emma across the continent-sized structure just so she could wind up dead anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wasnt my thing, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, the game plays like a TPS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres barely any stealth. #$%
@#$ $#@ The guns, the controls, the lack of auto wall hugging. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its very jarring when people say it had the best gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the opposite. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then the lack of decent bosses, constant pandering with the cutscene prompts, and including every character ever in the game, those on-rail shooting parts, the immense amount of cutscenes, loading times, and installing each fucking act. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah and the ending shits over alot of the series and the game itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ You said something stupid that made no sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ But people actually like Quiet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know you cant read and all, but we sure as hell could do without 50 threads discussing the same game every second of the day, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please, do kill yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ CQC the s-ranks and head shot the rest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Silenced pistol is OP #$%
@#$ $#@ except Jar Jar can be likeable in small doses #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont NEED to go non-lethal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its encouraged since it is a Metal Gear after all, but once you have a decent staff on MB, you can do whatever you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone below S rank should be shot, anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ironic that the west is 10 years late to MGS as a society and yet Japan still uses fax machines regularly #$%
@#$ $#@ Extract the s-ranks and kill everybody else #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, they couldnt kill Huey without it being a retcon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who cares? #$%
@#$ $#@ They retconned everything else in the fucking series with MGSV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a pretty big retcon since the reason you do an underwater mission is because of Huey drowning Emma #$%
@#$ $#@ non-lethal was easymodo in the earlier games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rubber bullets and tranqs have no penetration in V #$%
@#$ $#@ the analyzer's there for a reason #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, there are downsides, but you can replay any mission at any time and get sweet A+ rank soldiers if you really need to. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont really consider it a limiting factor, at least not all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ You get volunteers if your heroism is high enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're easy as piss to cqc if you haven't set off any alarms though #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the THIRD CHILD was an Eva reference #$%
@#$ $#@ You think I waste my time analyzing targets? #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I just shoot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of them do have nice personalized weapons though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear to God,if I see one more cutscene with a dramatic slow mo super badass shot I'm going to snap my disc in too #$%
@#$ $#@ You might actually be too autistic to play video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Kaz said he was cutting off all ties with Zero and Cipher because they had proven to be too dangerous because of what Paz did with Zeke! #$%
@#$ $#@ Or did you not believe your best friend? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sorry if even I, Joe Autstic Schmoe can recognize an overused tactic by a director. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like shaky cam in a Michael Bay movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok every once in a while but dont shove it down our throats. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like you only have yourself to blame if you sneak past them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't it dead though fam #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it possible to play with bots #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, but the multiplayer is where it's at #$%
@#$ $#@ gets boring after a year or two of in game time just like all harvest moon games do #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre superior because they keep it simple. #$%
@#$ $#@ Complexity isnt a bad thing and BTN/64 are a little too simple and shallow, but most of the complexity newer HM games added made the game more annoying to play and not more enjoyable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive heard a lot about games like these. #$%
@#$ $#@ what is their main draw? #$%
@#$ $#@ i-i want fun too anon... #$%
@#$ $#@ So its like Scarface with legal products? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its already a year in japan right. #$%
@#$ $#@ when will they release the next game? #$%
@#$ $#@ In another year since they just made that new Popolocrois game back in June #$%
@#$ $#@ I get bored after about one in-game year, come back to it a few weeks or even a couple months later in real time, and then Im hooked all over again. #$%
@#$ $#@ So is Rune Factory 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ Do days really pass that slowly? #$%
@#$ $#@ Days in RF4 went pretty quickly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have a time but certainly quicker than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's some prime bait right there #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me proof that Rune Factory V will happen? #$%
@#$ $#@ I still don't know how they're going to combine Popolocrois with this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know, but don't expect any waifuing since Popolocrois already has a canon OTP and messing with that will just piss off the fans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure thing, faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ That figure has to include a cut of the licensing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no other valid way to spend 90 million on it, assuming 90 went to marketing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't bought an EA game since Dead Space 2 and the beta was mediocre as fuck so of course I won't #$%
@#$ $#@ Licensing what from whom? #$%
@#$ $#@ EA payed a shitton of money to get dibs on the SW license, much like they did with nfl #$%
@#$ $#@ You can already see all the game modes that will be available, the only content added on launch will be guns/cards/character customizing shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe if they had to buy a plane for the devs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wtf man thats a pants on head retarded statement. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe, maybe 1 million if they had to fly in from the other side of the world and stayed a week in penthouses. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean no vehicles sitting around. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre just power ups chillin in the middle of the map where everyone and their mothers can see you. #$%

@#$ $#@ Kakatte koi yo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats your favorite game Anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ I will play it and enjoy it more knowing you like it too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill never know the feeling of being said over something so trivial, either. #$%
@#$ $#@ What's truly pitiful is that you guys will never know the happiness of being truly the best AND you won't know the happiness of not giving a fuck : #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet you big bucks that Ive played it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That sonic lost world game looked really fun to me but everyone said it was shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was it as bad as everyone said? #$%
@#$ $#@ except when you are the number 1 on the leaderboard #$%
@#$ $#@ Parkour is great and all the but the game doesnt make any use of it after the first world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Counter Strike? #$%
@#$ $#@ That person is your younger brother. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the pessimistic view. #$%
@#$ $#@ The optimistic view would be to say its boring if you were on top. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not a fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the idiot's view. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its all about securing your place at the top. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's because they're all playing the vastly superior Pokemon Puzzle League #$%
@#$ $#@ me too tbh #$%
@#$ $#@ Multiverse theory. #$%
@#$ $#@ In an alternate reality, someone could possible be better than you at your favorite game, even if youre the best in THIS reality. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats best thing about life OP, always someone new out there to challenge you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not when you consider the fact that a game can continue to be played for generations. #$%
@#$ $#@ For some reason he put more emphasis on the "not the best nor the worst", or at least I remember it that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was too young and dumb to understand, maybe 4 or so, I thought there was no point in trying if I couldnt be the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I know what he meant and that he was right indeed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same, I have no one to play air dashers with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gravity has more compelling evidence though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, orders of magnitude more compelling evidence. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always play better when I'm mad because I'm way more focused. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing cheap can make me any more mad when Im already mad. #$%

@#$ $#@ of course not I'm a miserable sack of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree with you completely actually #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, youre actually depressed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im indifferent to skill, I enjoy playing against people of equal or greater skill so I can improve. #$%
@#$ $#@ good I play for fun you tryhard faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ tryhard is such a dumb term #$%
@#$ $#@ I only want to be good at socializing so I can have friends to play video games with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone is better than me at it. #$%
@#$ $#@ shut up tryhard #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets be mediocre together anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you do it, you cock gargling faggots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you make me feel bad for giggling at ragequitters. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah you're just bad #$%
@#$ $#@ Its true though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a sad quitter who will never improve if i keep doing it #$%
@#$ $#@ Being the best would mean constant practice to ensure that you stay there. #$%
@#$ $#@ But that just forces me to respond with , isnt it more fun to be the rival on the bests heels then the best? #$%
@#$ $#@ Being the best means you got it all to lose and people expect shit from you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being the dude on his heels means you want it so fucking bad with no strings attached. #$%
@#$ $#@ fkn whoops #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off goku #$%
@#$ $#@ oh, i'm not a tryhard, being better than you comes as naturally as breathing to me : #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it dead? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I could relive moments with my 3 other friends when we always squadded the fuck up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill never get to feel the joy of not ever dying in a helicopter, getting a million assists from friends again. #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy gets it #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt care about being bad if I had someone to be mediocre with. #$%
@#$ $#@ because they're terrible people with a terrible life #$%
@#$ $#@ Ignoring the fact that this is a predictable meme response, I cant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive peaked at a very mediocre level. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will always think of you when im doing bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would be mediocre with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what makes it fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets all be bad in bed #$%
@#$ $#@ I would probably be bad at sex, but you know you cant be a incompetent cuddler as long as you try. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess, but it might make things very awkward. #$%
@#$ $#@ But we all suck at them #$%
@#$ $#@ If we play together we could improve! #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill teach you how to land your 1f links better if you know what I mean. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people are just quick learners. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that if all my buddies and I get into the same game at the same time I'll always be quicker to pick up the mechanics and become the most efficient just because I'm a naturally quick learner compared to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Will I still be better than them after a few weeks? #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on the genre, but Im usually the best for the first week or so. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its all about pattern recognition and conditioning yourself to new experiences. #$%
@#$ $#@ Naturally quick reaction times dont hurt either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe we can teach each other to wrestle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to do stuff with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuff sounds nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Why I stopped playing online Fps games #$%
@#$ $#@ will you faggots please fuck off #$%

@#$ $#@ If that is true keep up the good work you could be number one #$%
@#$ $#@ I play melee and SF as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, when you consider most people in this thread are talking about games like TF2 and CS, then yeah, dota is a far more skill based game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive always wanted to play someone good at this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking love Tetris Attack but whenever I play someone at it I stomp them because they have no clue how to chain #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn I want Hestia to piss on me. #$%
@#$ $#@ a party game is not a skill intensive game nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Video games aren't skill intensive at all, you're just pushing buttons. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont like melee either but it does have a great fan base to keep it alive the past 14 years #$%
@#$ $#@ So, reaction time is not a skill? #$%
@#$ $#@ Strategy too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Both of those things are done in Melee, but it's a party game so those aren't really skillful to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are we talking about the samw Melee? #$%
@#$ $#@ How the hell is it a party game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Get a fight stick and practice the moves #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing against better players is always more fun than playing with shitters, id rather play with people who demolish me, and learn from my mistakes than develop bad habits playing with bad players. #$%
@#$ $#@ He couldnt get past spinning demon though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time he started getting hits in Id use spinning demon and the match was pretty much mine. #$%

@#$ $#@ I named him after myself, but there is a tutu dress that he or she can wear, so Im not sure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frisk is asian #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre androgynous and are meant to be your self-insert of sorts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh man, Im not sure if I want to do one after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean call me a pussy iif you want but I have a hard time playing games where I need to sacrifice allies and such, so this is kind of harsh for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the track is called Chill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not if you delete the hidden file to be truly above consequences. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wouldn't feel right #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ By the way, the magic artifact that the dog stole from me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a way I can recover it? #$%
@#$ $#@ or does it do something special? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or was it such a joke? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just a joke. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, I would impregnate goatmom. #$%
@#$ $#@ The dog residue was the true artifact. #$%
@#$ $#@ Infinite healing items on command and slightly faster infinite money than tem flakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chara pls die and stay die #$%
@#$ $#@ I REALLY want to stuff it in muffet. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of the music has an edited pitch in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I expected there to be a date with her or something but she barely shows up at the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ No date with Mettaton either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chara doesnt have a gender either, dum dum #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh so the evil child was a girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thought she was a boy for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ it might as well be #$%
@#$ $#@ Summer's over, get the fuck to bed or you'll miss school. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chara is androgynous as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre meant to be a representation of the player. #$%
@#$ $#@ Columbus Day is tomorrow for some people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chara doesnt have a confirmed gender, nor does Frisk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre fine as long as you have a total of 0 EXP throughout the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont need to grind encounters. #$%
@#$ $#@ All you gotta do is solve everybodys problems. #$%
@#$ $#@ So you need to get every enemy type, yes, but not every single enemy. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Papyrus is not a furry, nor sans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tho you dont fight him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also this boss was pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes talking about getting all yellow names. #$%
@#$ $#@ When does he say this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't remember #$%
@#$ $#@ Whoa when does he say that to you #$%
@#$ $#@ He wore out his welcome really fast. #$%
@#$ $#@ you called #$%
@#$ $#@ Both Frisk and Chara are whatever gender you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ you cant get true pacifist on your very first run. #$%
@#$ $#@ You need neutral to unlock pacifist but specifically the date date with Alphys. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you didn't kill anyone in your current playthrough, you can go back and date her before fighting Asgore once you beat the game #$%
@#$ $#@ Kill Toriel and then start a new game I think #$%
@#$ $#@ When people say "true pacifist run" that's obviously different than a simple "pacifist run" isn't it? #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, you get the same ending, it's just that their credits quote is different if you didn't meet them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked her interactions with Papyrus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other times she felt disingenuous. #$%
@#$ $#@ there is neutral and genocide. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont kill anyone in a neutral playthrough besides Asgore then load your save after fucking up Flowey. #$%
@#$ $#@ the save should take your directly before Asgore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to the hotel before the core and Papyrus will tell you to visit Alphys. #$%
@#$ $#@ This will get you on track for true pacifist, provided you never killed anyone before killing Asgore #$%
@#$ $#@ Smells like fish. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't buy that explanation at all, because you haven't run through the game when the game straight up tells you "BY THE WAY, RELOAD TO KEEP GOING". #$%
@#$ $#@ Sucks for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon Papyrus blushes in the game #$%
@#$ $#@ The main difference between a neutral and regular pacifist is that a neutral run has to start over and not kill anybody, while a pacifist run can just reload their last save and go straight to the alphys date and true lab #$%
@#$ $#@ man, I chopped that niggas brains out after his fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt say shit to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I knew beforehand to load it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your run isn't over when reloading doesn't reload from where you saved but rather to a point where events unfold differently. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats called continuing. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it were a different run, youd start over. #$%
@#$ $#@ For fuck sakes you damn well know what I mean just fuck off already #$%
@#$ $#@ You killed the one person who remembers when you kill someone and you still think you deserved a pacifist ending? #$%
@#$ $#@ Get real. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well no, you can get the "best ending for a neutral route" even if you killed a random normal monster as long as you spared all the plot characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ And THAT does not allow you to continue into a pacifist ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to show Undyne my disgusting hentai collection then take advantage of her vulnerable state. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you saw that text you messed up your genocide run. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes supposed to say he still believes in you before perishing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Show us faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Do something about it, nerdzo #$%
@#$ $#@ git gud or edit the file. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'll play out different, if you don't stick to a side though then you'll get a neutral ending, #$%
@#$ $#@ You will only get the neutral ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything has to be killed for proper genocide route. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neutral, fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, what, no one will acknowledge that I killed damn near everyone? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats kind of boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ For genocide you have to kill random encouters in the ruins until you get "but nobody came". #$%
@#$ $#@ Same with every area #$%
@#$ $#@ Undyne will. #$%
@#$ $#@ The neutral ending is the same always but has different dialogue depending on what you did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone needs to create a guideline for a Sadistic Bastard run. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like genocide, but you pick the cruelest options when you kill betraying Toriel, killing Dogaressa before Dogamy, killing 02 after 01 admits his feelings etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ just to be the most horrible bastard you can possibly be. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad you cannot rape her corpse, or any other corpse since they disappear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you based anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Chara #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont jack off to em or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ its like watching a train wreck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to sleep, Chara. #$%
@#$ $#@ They lived just fine with Humans for a good long while, but then they made the extremely stupid mistake of becoming a threat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its literally in the opening cutscene before the main menu. #$%
@#$ $#@ h-game conversion mod when? #$%
@#$ $#@ Instead of killing you rape monsters until their souls explode #$%
@#$ $#@ No, Chara was after the barrier went up, Asriel had to use Chara's soul to get out of there with Chara's body. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there really any difference? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've never not been ok with porn before, I'm not ok with it today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then why do you have them saved, barffaggot? #$%
@#$ $#@ Listen, all I'm saying is that they're safer underground. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, if a single dopey child could genocide their entire race, could you imagine the magnitude of destruction an angsty teenager could do? #$%
@#$ $#@ In asgores bed room like everyone else? #$%
@#$ $#@ In true pacifist at least they seem to be getting along fine on the surface #$%
@#$ $#@ Please put Undertale in the OP next time so it filters correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ More like Santa Cuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah dog end after the one of the darkest moments in the game, then have her walk off stage and flowey getting mad that theres too little killing going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ See a psych. #$%
@#$ $#@ You poor thing... #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that smug little shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dedicated my whole genocide run JUST for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes lonely and he thinks all his friends are on vacation and will be coming back soon/eventually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats pretty heartbreaking man. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should totally beat Asgore again immediately first, Flowey does some funny shit if you do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont key your own car. #$%
@#$ $#@ what is embarrassing about the dialogue? #$%
@#$ $#@ He remembers that you already beat his Omega Flowey form and just goes "fuck this" and leaves. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to think Toby was on drugs when he came up with this shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then you havent finshed True pacifist, get to it anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ DETERMINED AS FUCK. #$%
@#$ $#@ I may be a shotagoatfucker but Im not insufferable about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ consider suicide #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga, you are really dumb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fo real. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats literally the only trial-and-error puzzle in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre done! #$%
@#$ $#@ I answered him already if you cant already understand that. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he spares every boss, he gets a neutral ending scenario involving all of the boss monsters being alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ The enemies arent taken into account for that approach. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fucking first hint tells you the solution #$%
@#$ $#@ Congrats on giving into the bloodlust, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck is up with those yellow arrows? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im stuck on them. #$%
@#$ $#@ They go the opposite way. #$%
@#$ $#@ So if its pointing down it attacks from the up spot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll jump to the opposite side before the reach you. #$%
@#$ $#@ its okay to be stupid sometimes anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ legit retard #$%
@#$ $#@ Then stop fucking playing and refund it you whiny bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good taste #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off #$%
@#$ $#@ Random encounters are pretty easy, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to zoom by them outside the ruins/in Snowdin, just unequip the Stick and use it from your Item screen when fighting any of the dogs. #$%
@#$ $#@ It gets better once best characters are introduced. #$%
@#$ $#@ Undyne is mah waifu, post more #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeh, chara killed himself so he could get out of the barrier and then go to the human village and collect 6 souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ IM GONNA PUT TARTAR SAUCE ON THOSE ABS AND LICK IT OFF! #$%
@#$ $#@ Neo-/v/ everyone #$%
@#$ $#@ Hold on, what happens when you mercy asgore after killing flowey? #$%
@#$ $#@ Does anything happen if you use the stick on Sans? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cannot think of a more appropriate use for this image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, need to try that. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is just meming around. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is basically /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its ok to pirate it as long you play it, for it already sold more than 100K. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alphys pls #$%
@#$ $#@ flowey kills him but then it says "lets get over with this" or something like that, then you just appear in flowey's room but he's not there, cross the door and the game is over #$%
@#$ $#@ Glad I didnt waste $10 on a shit game by some faggot that probably came from /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only died once to see if he would remark on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ When pc games shut themselves off is my favorite shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Check gives you a clue on what you should do. #$%
@#$ $#@ You usually only have to do an action once early on, though some enemies require you repeating an action Ice Cap, those Dragon Knight things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most of the bosses you just have to outlast and theres no action you can do to stop them - though a few can be weakened through action. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a girl, it's 100% a guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ so is fighting completely worthless if you plan to spare? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 100% GHOST you fool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what it seemed like to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ you can do it on the first go, but Toby took into account that a lot of shitters will play his game so he made the fight easier the more you died. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, the attacks hit less the less HP you have #$%
@#$ $#@ I let's played the game for GF after I finished it on a new game, and I got through it after my first try, so I don't think it is scripted. #$%
@#$ $#@ In 99% of the fights, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since its a fucking robot I can put it a cybervagina. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fight is reasonable and you actually have a lot of health. #$%
@#$ $#@ The health bar isnt realiable representation though. #$%
@#$ $#@ You have more hp the at the lower bits of the bar. #$%
@#$ $#@ You never have to use the fight command. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only time it could potentially help a pacifist run is to boost ratings in the Mettaton EX fight but there are more effective methods. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, you get gold, and with god, items that make the pacifist runs easier, for you only have 20 hp. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont understand why being a meme game is a bad thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like memes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was bustin' up when the GUTSMAN'S ASS music played before the mad dummy fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, there's being a meme game and then there's being a game meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ so its one of those bosses huh? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off Jerry #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you say never when even people who havent played the game know that there is one place where you are forced to press the fight button a few times? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pay attention, stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ goats are so weird, man #$%
@#$ $#@ No problem anon #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its the worst game to LP because no one should watch you play it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its short enough that you have every reason to experience it yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit I would be a massive cunt too if I had some retarded journo asking me such shitty loaded questions and rubbing their pretentious bullshit in my face trying to get me to corroborate their fancanon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might be spacing something out. #$%
@#$ $#@ I seem to remember never pressing fight on my true end run, although I guess I did have to use it against Asgore and Flowey in Neutral end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are those what youre talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ Help my memory out here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play one of Nappsterghosts tunes and walk out to the quiet area. #$%
@#$ $#@ He and Woshua will show up and... #$%
@#$ $#@ I wont spoil it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shoulda used the stick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno man but if it ruins a letsplayers day then I think I like it a lot more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im on the fight right now and have the stick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill see if anything happens. #$%
@#$ $#@ explain kingdescription then. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you play the whole game only once and go straight to the true ending you still have to press fight during the Asgore battle before you get to load your save and redo that segment without fighting him. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wonder if it was always toby's design for a determination-associated symbol, or something extrapolated from everdraed's omega flowy design and then used for other things #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a game that best experienced by yourself with zero expectations, so of course having a crowd of spoiling backseat gamers ruins the whole thing #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how of ALL the fucking characters people chose to draw vomit porn of, it was of the LITERAL SKELETONS WITHOUT INTERNAL ORGANS. #$%
@#$ $#@ song that might play when you fight sans? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you know how much it costs to watch someone play a game you dont own. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure without the determination bullshit Frisk would have ended up like all the other dead humans. #$%
@#$ $#@ in a new york minute #$%
@#$ $#@ Im bretty sure that the Slaughterhouse theme isnt in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the cost was an issue you could just download the file. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frisk just got really lucky. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah, most probably #$%
@#$ $#@ What do I even do after Neutral &gt; Pacifist &gt; Genocide? #$%
@#$ $#@ The song that might play when you fight sans #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitch I didnt die once. #$%
@#$ $#@ So this Hussie is what eventually became Aaron then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Soulless Pacifist! #$%
@#$ $#@ Hussie DOES love being strong... #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do they eat spaghetti, chips and burgers? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the implication was that Flowey created the Save and Load feature? #$%
@#$ $#@ Though Chara is definitely an influential factor since youre constantly hearing his memories. #$%
@#$ $#@ Trying a little hard there? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's canonical that monsters don't shit because it's explained that their food works differently than humans'. #$%
@#$ $#@ anon dont be so autistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing is impossible to avoid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just shoot it out of the way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Killing his little droids doesn't count against your pacifism, they're not alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its really more than appropriate considering the combat sprites are all tweened. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you tried shooting? #$%
@#$ $#@ Felt like playing a Cave game, but 10 times hyper #$%
@#$ $#@ cum on anon, you could have legitimate complains if you actually played the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ wew lad smhid fam ikurbtt #$%
@#$ $#@ Contain your autism, fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you keep pushing in a direction while making some other window active, say your browser, the character keeps walking in place and encounters enemies while you fuck around the net. #$%
@#$ $#@ I assumed everybody would realize it's a goat skull immediately because of all the damn goat characters, particularly Asriel but at that point a normal player wouldn't really know about Asriel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still, you meet goatmom immediately so at least everybody knows goats have significance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Absolutely fucking determined. #$%
@#$ $#@ here, you forgot your frog image matching your text, my dear anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shmorky Muffet? #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy is so over the top its hilarious enough to be his own character in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was even more hype than true pacifist since it felt more like a struggle #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, I didnt look too hard at first but that is definitely a shmorky muffet. #$%
@#$ $#@ thanks, towards the end of the post I couldnt really think of stupid bullshit so I just started spamming the word meme and nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ all smiles here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck really? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was all garbage and threw it away. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it #$%
@#$ $#@ Sadly when you convert something to a gif the framerate gets changed to 30 fps and the animation is a lot slower #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, cactuses are the most tsundere of plants, and omega flowey is part cactus #$%
@#$ $#@ But sans does a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you tell him that you dont think Papyrus is cool, he tells you straight out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not really damage control. #$%
@#$ $#@ I absolutely admit the post was mindless shitposting made by a moron. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't like the game sure, but it's not to the degree where I hate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was just bored so Im shitposting in an undertale thread because my other post in the Persona thread was ignored. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly the game isnt that impressive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gameplay wise it lacks depth and a pull factor for a second run, unless, of course, you consider the mediocre narrative. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its short, and not worth the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ It tries too hard to leave an impact on the player instead of staying subtle with its tone. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bosses and music are really good, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ And there are no examples of him doing anything in any run except Genocide when its too late for anyone. #$%
@#$ $#@ What's the youtuber's name? #$%
@#$ $#@ youse mum, fafa. #$%
@#$ $#@ everything you say about the narrative is wrong considering its arborescence. #$%
@#$ $#@ shut up wankah #$%
@#$ $#@ Love the determined face. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thread needs more Sans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Genocide run explains a bit more in case you want to find out yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ i always had suspicion on why Chara and frisk look so similar, but we don't know if they are truly related in any way, so all we can do is theorize about it #$%
@#$ $#@ no, fuck off frisku #$%
@#$ $#@ It sort of implies that you, the player, are a separate individual watching over Frisk. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are the one who invokes Charas name at the beginning of the game, which leads to the possession in all likelihood. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your help, as well as Floweys discovery of the save and reset system are what keep Frisk determined and able to go on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Determination represents the desire by the player to go on and do absolutely everything within the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You must get all the loot, fight all the monsters, do all the dungeons, etc; it can be both a positive and negative thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being determined awakened Chara, and destroying souls and gaining EXP and LOVE are what allowed him to grow powerful. #$%
@#$ $#@ When I say careful with pronouns I just mean there are androgynous characters in the game and the game uses gender neutral pronouns like "they" and "them" even though its grammatically incorrect. #$%
@#$ $#@ The intent was more so that anyone could play the game and self insert as the character rather than appease the xims and xers or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he just gets bored of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only good times from here on out. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wonder how a 8-y/o kid could be that deep and fucking terrifying at the same time #$%
@#$ $#@ He tells you to reload your last save so just do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, but I got the neutral ending with her dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt bother saving her. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt intentional. #$%
@#$ $#@ If someone colors this well for me, I will legit suck their cock. #$%
@#$ $#@ he kinda sounds like a "chaotic neutral" on those faggot charts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hed kill good or bad guys without a second though, just to get better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like a generic RPG player. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not gonna wait that long. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill just make my own Star Fox game in Unity with a bunch of OC Donut Steel characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Miyamoto wanted a new pet project to mess around with, and he decided on Star Fox seeing all the 'fun' gamepad gimmicks he could shove into it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise Nintendo wouldnt have bothered with another Star Fox. #$%
@#$ $#@ Star Fox Zero looks like this because the system resources are spent having to render the game on the gamepad too, both at 60fps. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't look shit to be a throwback to SF64, it's done as a necessity. #$%
@#$ $#@ Younger players who play consoles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Phone tots dont pay attention to SFZ at all because its not on a phone and doesnt let you buy ammunition with real money. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Running the game with two separate cameras effectively cuts their system resources in half not to mention that the game is meant to run at a constant 60 FPS, so there are not enough resources to do something more impressive looking. #$%
@#$ $#@ However, the art direction for the game is decidedly kludgey as a means of working around their hardware limitations. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are trying to mask the lack of system resources by making the game be a throwback to Star Fox 64, so they can effectively say its supposed to be ugly, even though the ugly art direction is meant to work with the technical limitations. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes because THATS always a good idea! #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I guess I meant that in a "it's not going to be a 'big' release even though it should be" kind of way #$%
@#$ $#@ You should just start a kickstarter to raise money to put your furry race into Star Citizen #$%
@#$ $#@ is this still a thing? #$%
@#$ $#@ id legit play it if it had great gameplay, even if it had fanfiction tier writing and characters #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the guy still posts demos on his Youtube channel. #$%
@#$ $#@ of course it doesn't have good gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ [mean comment about how you look and probably smell] #$%
@#$ $#@ Ironically, the villains in the old Wing Commander games were furries. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if thats why there are so many furries on the RSI boards? #$%
@#$ $#@ Miss her yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo's developers have admitted that they've spent much of the 8th generation playing catch up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre going through all the HD growing pains that most developers went through on the PS3 and Xbox 360, and the fact that they sat out of the HD transition is probably why they are having growing pains making an open-world adventure game. #$%
@#$ $#@ They confirmed a catlike race a long ass time ago, didnt they? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Vanduul have some cat-like features but they are wholly alien looking, and at any rate they only have small patches of body hair. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was going to be like F-Zero GX and AX where there was a home console and arcade version. #$%
@#$ $#@ The on-foot missions were originally going to be first person, as well, but ultimately ended up getting changed to third person. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think ultimately that was the right decision, since the appeal of on-foot missions is to remind the player that they are actually playing as Fox, and that connection wouldnt have been there if all we saw was a floating gun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd have to fuck up pretty bad to make a game worse than command. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think Zero will be good enough to wash away the disappointment of Command though, because it's bringing in a host of its own disappointments. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think ti was called Star Fox Armada #$%
@#$ $#@ The problem with Miyamoto's approach to Star Fox is that it's like he keeps making the pilot episode of a TV show over and over again. #$%
@#$ $#@ agreed, it would have been better in a Rogue Squadron kind of style #$%
@#$ $#@ They never did say what happened to Scales. #$%
@#$ $#@ the implication was that his troops either killed him or usurped him leaving him powerless. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember saying months ago, before the SFZ reveal "they had better not bring Andross back again." #$%
@#$ $#@ Then Miyamoto does me one better by making the whole game be a rehash of SF64. #$%
@#$ $#@ they can work with Star Fox, they just don't have to use Command or Zero's look #$%
@#$ $#@ What is wrong with Zeros look? #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks like the art work from the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ The in-game graphics look like Star Fox 64 with beveled edges and low-res bump mapping. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont seem to know how to take proper screen shots, here is how it is done. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair they did get rid of the duckface in more recent art, but the heads are still comically big, and they went way overboard with the fur effects. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still think the best is tie between Adventures and Assault, primarily because he looks a bit more adult there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Peppy looks like Dumbledore #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck did your file size increase #$%
@#$ $#@ shits crisp, yo #$%
@#$ $#@ But it is retired, meleefags forcing it is another matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bad analogy anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did anything go right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a screencap of a wall of text saying what went wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ the cars drive like tanks there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like they're heavy as fuck when not stunt jumping #$%
@#$ $#@ but that's how cars work in the irl #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically, the story was a bit slapped together. #$%
@#$ $#@ The missions were fun, but needed more variety and hacker oriented shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aiden was a bit bland because he's obviously secretive, but still should've had more emotion and personality. #$%
@#$ $#@ The hacking is semi interesting but I wouldnt pay $15 for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got it off of G2A for $3 and I still felt like I paid too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy it for 15, don't buy dlc until theres a sale, even though there's a few things that hold it back it is still really fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was sold as "thr next big franchise!" #$%
@#$ $#@ without the thought that maybe they should have made a good game first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same issue destiny and titanfall had really. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hopefully they stop that backwards bullshit after 3 failed attempts from all the major publishers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Titanfall was kinda fun #$%
@#$ $#@ It was still a spectacular failure from EAs point of view. #$%
@#$ $#@ The gameplay was there, to a point, but the content was not, and nobody wants to play the same 15 maps over and over for $60. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they removed it why didnt they change the opening? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a huge fuck you to keep that. #$%
@#$ $#@ too much hype its an ok game just hoping ubisoft do a ass creed 2 to the sequel #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill give you that only because they should have waited until their 2 or 3rd installment before they started shilling as the next big GTA tier game. #$%
@#$ $#@ What I wont give you is Titanfall. #$%
@#$ $#@ LITERALLY ANY FPS that comes out is compared and considered the "Call of Duty killer". #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember Homefront? #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember Medal of Honor? #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember Frontlines Fuel of War? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even when they weren't trying to be the next CoD or better than CoD that's the first thing faggot ass gamers, youtubers, reviewers and everyone like spews out. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it's either look like a bitch that has no faith in their game or just go with whatever everyone is saying so they don't look like they know their game is going to be shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit like this is why the internet age is ruining videogames more than theyre helping them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyve been making the games shittier by introducing great weapons, and stripping them away in future games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The hidden gun and the crossbow are a hundred times better than any of the pistols theyve added. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything OP, everything #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is Syndromes hair so fucking huge? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pissing me off. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's the villain of the video game he's in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zangeif is a bad guy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well he was doing the "right thing" Mike and Sully are basically fucking terrorist in Monsters Inc #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is Ridley at the bottom of the Star Wars list? #$%
@#$ $#@ You want me to give you the summary for the Jolie movie or you want to look it up yourself it's dumb #$%
@#$ $#@ That retarded live action version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me the summary please. #$%
@#$ $#@ It'll be fun to read your take on it #$%
@#$ $#@ If Randall is as good an engineer as that anyway, why did they even bother giving him a partner? #$%
@#$ $#@ The actress is called Daisy Ridley #$%
@#$ $#@ There's multiple story modes #$%
@#$ $#@ In University hes sort of nice-ish, but ultimately joins the antagonists, then sits in the background until the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the playsets are there own stories in the universe of their franchises but toy box takeover is a mash-up story #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Rapunzel play like Bayonetta? #$%
@#$ $#@ If there's a live action version of a character it seems like they'll always go for that version. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was a poll for which characters you'd like to see added to DI, the one that ended up just being Darkwing Duck vs Mabel from Gravity Falls and that had Alice from the live action movie as a choice #$%
@#$ $#@ Its because the live action versions are the most versions of the character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll always go for the most recent versions. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Cinderella gets in the next edition its going to be the live action version. #$%
@#$ $#@ I work in a place that deals in 2nd hand games and we accept Disney Infinity figures. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes they come in with the codes intact and I take them to redeem in the PC version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got like 10 characters and the Marvel starter pack this way. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is what they did to one of the coolest bad guys in the Disney universe #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember no one was ever truly bad it was just unfair circumstances that made them do bad shit #$%
@#$ $#@ did darkwing duck win? #$%
@#$ $#@ The combat in 3.0 actually feels pretty platinum, with air combos and finishers and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rapunzel kinda sucks since she's from 1.0 but if you give her a pack tool then she's GOAT, her autoheal is great too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not as retarded as Train Simulators DLCs but goddamn. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the shitty Angelina Jolie version. #$%
@#$ $#@ God you cucks are paranoid. #$%
@#$ $#@ They just reversed the hero and villan roles. #$%
@#$ $#@ And it was a decent film. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit, someone whose brain is actually fucking functional. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck sadfags, Disgust and Sunny D for life #$%
@#$ $#@ Real soon him and Grievous #$%
@#$ $#@ this reeks of shindol, please tell me it is #$%
@#$ $#@ Chinese harem? #$%
@#$ $#@ hotglue, i dare say. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id kill to see a Gaston live action film just to see if they actually try to make him a gray character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Itd be hilarious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, thats pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats a pack tool? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was by far the most disappointing part of the movie #$%
@#$ $#@ Randall did nothing wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hotglue guns aren't really that expensive #$%
@#$ $#@ You only need one character per plot, but each playset includes 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't know Vanellope knew High Time and Helm Breaker #$%
@#$ $#@ LETS GET DANGEROUS! #$%
@#$ $#@ The dinosaurs are all too big. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are 4 of them in the game, and theyre all giant mounts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, what a waste. #$%
@#$ $#@ The first Mickey that was based on the Sorcerer's Apprentice was cute enough, I don't know why they went for such a weird and plain version for 3.0 #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause people wanna fuck him #$%
@#$ $#@ What I fear most is that theyll do this with other Disney villains. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try to make them look like theyre not actually evil. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cruellas next. #$%
@#$ $#@ they're already in the planing stage for a cruella de vil film #$%
@#$ $#@ This is new Maleficent #$%
@#$ $#@ The Playset campaigns have you play as a set of specific characters that come with it, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are those characters available elsewhere in the game Toybox, w/e or only within the campaign? #$%
@#$ $#@ Basically I want to know if theres a reason to buy standalone figures. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're lieing #$%
@#$ $#@ They already kinda did in the Once Upon a Time tv series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, she was still actually evil, but they bullshitted some plot reasons that made it impossible for her to kill anyone which caused her unable to defend herself when someone actually tried to kill her. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a fucking bizarre post mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unca Scrooge when?? #$%
@#$ $#@ Same reason Emma Watson is going to be Belle #$%
@#$ $#@ I still don't understand what constitutes a character being a Disney Princess these days since said character doesn't have to be a princess but people like Lilo aren't while Alice is #$%
@#$ $#@ She was a psychopath who killed her mother and skinned her dogs, for fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ also this #$%
@#$ $#@ Too OP, King of the Klondike never #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I said she was still evil. #$%
@#$ $#@ But they still were like Oh no, she cant kill anyone anymore! #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes completely harmless! #$%
@#$ $#@ right before she gets killed off. #$%
@#$ $#@ And they don't count Kida who is actually a princess/queen or Megara #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats really stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they ever make this mother fucker not villainous, then Ill be impressed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Toybox Takeover is good and I'd personally say yes #$%
@#$ $#@ He sounds half dead when they wheel him out to voice scrooge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit the VA in the ducktales remaster was all over the place #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hope Wreck-It Ralph 2 is good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love this picture #$%
@#$ $#@ THROUGH FAIR AND STORRRRMY WEATHERRRRR #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno man, those look bigger than Hulk. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fucking filename #$%
@#$ $#@ Why can't they shink a character 10 times, but can enlarge another 100 times #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know why, but that part was creepy to me as a kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ that scene gave me a fetish for cacti, I imagined them to be flexible and rubbery, despite having thorns #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna need a "???% mad" edit, on the double #$%
@#$ $#@ post your dick #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you rike it #$%
@#$ $#@ I really ended up digging how he looks, but I always liked the ears he had in the forties. #$%
@#$ $#@ Minnie came out better though. #$%
@#$ $#@ So whats the deal here, can I use 1.0 figures in the other two or do I have to buy all three versions if I want to use the characters from each of them? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just bought Sadness. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her character ability is great #$%
@#$ $#@ Ain't a girl no more with that booty #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent seen Inside Out yet but I totally want Anger. #$%
@#$ $#@ He comes packed with Joy only, but if you see the movie youll realize Joy is the best anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disgust &gt; Joy #$%
@#$ $#@ HER FUCKING NAME IS CRUELLA, WHAT THE FUCK?? #$%
@#$ $#@ OH BOY #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess technically they were doing bad shit as far as he knew. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not even talking about fuckability. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes the most nuanced character, like Woody. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there something you want to tell us? #$%
@#$ $#@ I figured it went without saying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just that curtsy she does makes me hot and bothered. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its out on Tuesday but I found a shop selling it early #$%
@#$ $#@ tfw Disney makes Square use the live action Maleficent in future KH games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Infinity could use some more hometown support. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is Peter Pan a baby? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its really pretty great. #$%
@#$ $#@ The 3.0 playsets are the best yet and toy box has always been good but they added some stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I...dont know what you're trying to actually say here besides show off your power level #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice, hadn't seen this #$%
@#$ $#@ Am I missing anything if I dont get 1.0 for Stitch? #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet they give him a really good mode to play through thats somehow much better than his last few games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, since it's the only way to get the levels based on the new movie, I think it'll move just fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the playsets have girl characters though. #$%
@#$ $#@ They said they decided to do this because of the surprisingly high amount of girls buying/playing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it has princesses and shit but its a combat game with fairly complex level editor. #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt 3.0 on pc? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not just pirate everything? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want it so bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was a bad guy in the first film and a good guy after that #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I thought he looked pretty big from pics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hype for Battlegrounds for sure but I just want 3.0 Marvel figures already, can't wait for Hulkbuster/Ultron #$%
@#$ $#@ How was he ever good? #$%
@#$ $#@ The point about pirates is that theyre never good. #$%
@#$ $#@ A "good" pirate is a corsair. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like Francis Drake. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh snap randall is in it? #$%
@#$ $#@ 10/10 husbando #$%
@#$ $#@ Except Randall was the villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ He wasnt evil in the sense of most villains, but he was definitely the villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ Crack-It-Steve ill agree shouldnt be in the grey area either #$%
@#$ $#@ Grey area. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grey area implies that hes more anti-hero, or misunderstood villain. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was never misunderstood or even an anti-hero. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was a straight up bad guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was more pirate than most of the characters in all the movies combined. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, his crew were more grey area than him #$%
@#$ $#@ You niggas take this shit too seriously #$%
@#$ $#@ I want Jango Fett. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, you hid them good, motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just like Greedo. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I must correct a joke in a kids game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at this slimeball. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hmm ... #$%
@#$ $#@ no, Id much rather play as someone cool who shot first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe it's you that don't take it seriously enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ He does the voicework in the game too I think #$%
@#$ $#@ He sounded alot better in that one newer Mickey Mouse cartoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it a "rule"? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought they said they had issues getting them to work in gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like how would something with 4 legs climb a pole? #$%
@#$ $#@ c...combine it with anna to create lesbiancest #$%
@#$ $#@ It's fun to see the divide between "too big to voice some video game" and "yeah I'll do the voice in the game too why not" with something like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remove the vehicle in a vehicle zone and you'll see their full-bodied "driving" animation #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats exactly what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a rule they're just trying to figure it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like having Simba ride Arlo. #$%
@#$ $#@ They gotta make this all fit on a disk too. #$%
@#$ $#@ And they probably have to jump through a bunch of hoops with Disney to get them approved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sure someone at Pixar would shit themselves and cancel the whole idea if he saw Arlo riding himself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well they obviously made it work with a racoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wont be the same for like a lion or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, it could just be that certain actors never get extended an offer, due to perceived cost, or over-zealous agents. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet there could have been a realistic chance they could have gotten Vin to fire off a few "I am Groot"s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jason Lee probably jumped at the chance, since its more money for the Scientology pit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just cynical when it comes to that sort of thing and assume theyre all dicks if they dont do voice work and stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just a costume #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you tweet a Vine of you hot-gluing Quorra to Johnny V? #$%
@#$ $#@ COMPLETELY ERECT #$%
@#$ $#@ That would be awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even though I own one I still stand by the idea that not selling it was a huge mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was really lame for fans of Infinity and KH. #$%
@#$ $#@ They take his land but are considered good? #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably looks retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit that sounds fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, of course. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want DOOOOOOM #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah the glorious PC version. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant wait for 3.0 to come out. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Wii U would run at 5 FPS with that many things happening. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well Im sure they wanted you to be able to web sling in every toy box. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not every player is going to make a level with giant buildings for you to sling off of. #$%
@#$ $#@ AND THEY SAY A HERO WILL SAVE US #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy her? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not big on characters I cant use in playsets. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, this is a picture for ants. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, thats a picture for antz. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its for ants, but it has antz in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, this is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could fap to this honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, thats a picture for ants of a picture for ants with antz in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah but Ralph used to be a "bad guy" which is the whole point duhhhhhhh #$%
@#$ $#@ You can hate the movie but it doesn't make the "grey area" thing inaccurate #$%
@#$ $#@ ANT-MAN FOR DISNEY INFINITY CONFIRMED WHEN? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes checking out her nails. #$%
@#$ $#@ she's a girl dummy #$%
@#$ $#@ The only Disney Infinity figure I want is Disgust. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not even interested in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK YES. #$%
@#$ $#@ So hyped, is there anything else? #$%
@#$ $#@ PC version is free, dumbass #$%
@#$ $#@ 1 million hours in MS paint. #$%
@#$ $#@ you tried #$%
@#$ $#@ Get the game and buy all the Rebels figures, maybe they'll make her just for you #$%
@#$ $#@ I also would like to know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although I was considering Airland Battle. #$%
@#$ $#@ is retarded but cheats alot, for instance he can always see your units, his decks have more units that listed and he gains more points aka "money" to get more reinforcements than you, he will either bum rush you into oblivion or get himself into infinite bottleneck when you can proceed to rape him with score around 6000:400. #$%
@#$ $#@ Campaign is complete shit, the MP is like the unrisen Christ, glorious but thoroughly dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't bother buying it unless you have people to play it with, you'll give up. #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon, I wanted to play as my country in the only game other than MoH Warfighter where the ADF is represented. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just get World in Conflict and be done with it #$%
@#$ $#@ Very few people still play ALB, plus the devs fucked the balance and never fixed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you not recognize the legend? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is he eating? #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ its an indian food restaurant so i assume he's got a giant slab of Naan #$%
@#$ $#@ literally the best twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ He is way more extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeme than gay ass kojima. #$%
@#$ $#@ ninety nine nights two for the xbot 360 #$%
@#$ $#@ why is cat sad? #$%
@#$ $#@ poorly cooked dough, by the looks of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cuz tak no dreds #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm curious, how do you know what naan is #$%
@#$ $#@ no not vegan but certain carbs that contain sugar, starving a tumor from sugar shrinks it apparently #$%
@#$ $#@ well brits are up and thats their national bread #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought muslim food and goats and stuff was staple for them #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone who has been to an indian restaurant knows what it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its delicious. #$%
@#$ $#@ That shit is dank #$%
@#$ $#@ PAJEET MY SON!!! #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt eat the whole thing just by itself, but fresh naan is a miracle of the universe. #$%
@#$ $#@ he must be brit #$%
@#$ $#@ Eat it with curry and stuff man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are they near the designated streets? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's tasty #$%
@#$ $#@ POO IN ___? #$%
@#$ $#@ I live in Bumblefuck, Oklahoma and even we know about naan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking delicious. #$%
@#$ $#@ LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED TO DO A POO! #$%
@#$ $#@ i ran out f cats #$%
@#$ $#@ And I'm outta naan #$%
@#$ $#@ I have grafics, is that good? #$%
@#$ $#@ If i weren't white, i'd be successful and happy and would be able to release my true potential and take my rightful place in history. #$%

@#$ $#@ I'm just glad he's still alive and being extreme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its bad enough that this poor guy had to get cancer, but then Konami had to go and give his career cancer too. #$%
@#$ $#@ why do you want a tiny benis anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whatll you think reach maximum first, his cancer or his hair? #$%
@#$ $#@ He's a weeb who's shitposting his fantasy of grorius nihon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, the /Asia loves white guys/ thing is a meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japans an extremely xenophopic and ultranationlistic country. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't forget that he's also broken his femur twice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you have fun playing it? #$%
@#$ $#@ In my case I was getting frustrated at myself because I can't beat my own fastest record which is like 10-12 seconds slower than the faster players #$%
@#$ $#@ I've recently finally got to play Gran Turismo 4 and 5 and I'm having a god damn blast #$%
@#$ $#@ NFS Hot Pursuit 2 2002 #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the game but no many hours I sink into it Im not improving at all, I dont know how to, there are times I think I just press retry over and over again for over an hour just because Im messing up a tiny bit a corner and consider that I have to retry from the beginning because I touched a wall or lost too much speed and it just seems to be getting worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ when I say say record I mean best times in Time Trial, I dont have the kind of precision of getting near the walls without touching them like the best players can. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like Im not trying to get better, I just dont have the skills to get better. #$%
@#$ $#@ I take a break to calm down and relax a little. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, its Extreme Stage which is a port of Arcade Stage 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh bummer, 4 sucked when I tried it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Their physics experiment really didnt go well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe I was too used to the snappiness of 2/3 though. #$%
@#$ $#@ my fastest time on Akina downhill in Extreme Stage is 3"06"300 something which I can't beat anymore, while in Special Stage on PCSX2 I could finish Akina in 2"58 #$%
@#$ $#@ Use this #$%
@#$ $#@ Its an old as fuck image that has no relevance to anything #$%
@#$ $#@ HE UNDERSTOOD #$%
@#$ $#@ But I thought this was /v/! #$%
@#$ $#@ looks pretty dry to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ if it were humid it'd be much moldier #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the years-old image, newfag. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should become an hero. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always see this photo on /v/ but theres never any sauce. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the backstory? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never saw that angle before #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy why does Raye suck? #$%
@#$ $#@ is he playing pikmin? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its rare... #$%
@#$ $#@ like old school donkey kong rare #$%
@#$ $#@ lurk more #$%
@#$ $#@ I used to know a guy with a room like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder what ever happened to him... #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it was some super huge Nintendo fanboy on Nsider or Neogaf or something way way back in the day. #$%
@#$ $#@ He posted his setup as a joke. #$%
@#$ $#@ That explains the play pen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to give you a chance to explain why you have gout before I rip into you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would legitimately love to live in a room like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ A shame that it would attract spiders and shit though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck spiders. #$%
@#$ $#@ have fun losing your foot #$%
@#$ $#@ To gout? #$%
@#$ $#@ that pot pie. #$%
@#$ $#@ you may be relieved to know that urine is by far the most sterile substance produced by the human body, it gets more bacteria in it from touching the skin of your penis as you piss it out than exist in it naturally. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the uric acid makes it hostile to bacteria. #$%
@#$ $#@ gout was known as the king's disease for centuries, its high class as fuck show some respect #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd put it all on never because most of those bottles have cigarette butts in them and that's 10000 times worse than piss #$%
@#$ $#@ cool story #$%
@#$ $#@ just pour it out a window or something #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, in hindsight there are a lot of solutions to the urine dilemma I put myself in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could have simply put it on the left side of my chair instead of the right, where I always put my drinks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just couldnt really think straight. #$%
@#$ $#@ looks super dry nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember me of a friend that used to drink his beer with cigarettes ashes. #$%
@#$ $#@ fairly rude #$%
@#$ $#@ what do the tubes inflate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cigarette ashes are for the most part tasteless especially in beer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean idk about a whole cigarettes worth of ash but drinking something with a cigarette butt in it is the worst taste there is imo #$%
@#$ $#@ I want that Shana Poster #$%
@#$ $#@ i think it's for the fake cum but i'm not sure #$%
@#$ $#@ they don't inflate anything, those dildos can be made to pump cum-lube so even when you're alone you can still know t h e f e e l i n g o f b e i n g c u m m e d i n s i d e #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess people need their dragon dildos to be as life-like as possible #$%
@#$ $#@ fluorescent light kills it #$%
@#$ $#@ How's your neck #$%
@#$ $#@ Im strictly the fucker and never the fuckee in my sex life, but my girlfriends seem to go crazy when I blast inside without a condom, so there must be something cool about the feeling of being filled up to the brim with a hot load. #$%
@#$ $#@ if your crawlspace is wet, fix it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That turns into trouble if you leave it. #$%
@#$ $#@ you have some strong opinions on gout #$%
@#$ $#@ you should try prostate stimulation, its quite nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Think of the spiders though #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice computer Ahmed #$%
@#$ $#@ man that cpu is FRIED #$%
@#$ $#@ Meanwhile at the rape room #$%
@#$ $#@ Lying on the internet is not cool, got it? #$%
@#$ $#@ When did we ever like this shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the power of Unity #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the board youre looking for is /x/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never, /v/ has always had Lowtax's opinion on skinnyman #$%
@#$ $#@ I came here to post this and here you are #$%
@#$ $#@ oh okay, should I get downpour then? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want to play another SH game after 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried to like it, I really did, but when I started getting hit by evil cars and rushed by half a dozen evil bag ladies in the street, I couldnt take it anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you own a second-hand game shop? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because they always have copies of it and never the PS2 ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck, I always imagined big devs kept code in a care vault or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ God knows I would if I could make games like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do they keep losing or destroying the original copies of games that took them years to make? #$%
@#$ $#@ You wouldnt happen to have the PC port of 4, would you? #$%
@#$ $#@ But Ive heard it kinda sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its only the Japanese who do this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoy the charm of the game, I just wanted to experience it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ The port isn't all that good, you're better off emulating the PS2 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are a wonderful person. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been looking to get into SH for a while, this is wonderful, thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ How well does MGS 1 emulate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or just any of the games, really. #$%
@#$ $#@ PS1 games all emulate really well in my experience #$%
@#$ $#@ you shouldnt be using ePSXe at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you eat shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just use PSXfin because im a lazy shit who doesn't want to deal with plug ins and crap #$%
@#$ $#@ B-but, arent PCs... #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit this cant be real #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I agree I can't believe they charged money for that piece of shit 'hd' port #$%
@#$ $#@ It was real before it got patched. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh god, that looks so cheap. #$%
@#$ $#@ That water looks janky as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ People are too fucking helpless to do a minimum google search on their own these days #$%
@#$ $#@ The patch didnt fix the fog, they just added fog, which is still a problem because you can still see the fog wall in front of you and the color of fog they added was JUST grey, which looks fine enough in SH2 but in SH3 most of the time is spent around town in mid day with orange fog, so the grey fog mixes with the orange fog and turns blue. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a fucking travesty even after the patch, it just doesn't look AS shit in SH2. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shit is inexcusable regardless of losing codes and working from beta builds or whatever sorry for the shitty Lper couldn't find a commentary-less version #$%
@#$ $#@ suit yourself, I just had enough bad experiences with ePSXe to avoid it, it might be better now. #$%
@#$ $#@ what reason could you possibly have to prefer it? #$%
@#$ $#@ silent hill 2 HD is passable at best and silent hill 3 HD is completely unacceptable #$%
@#$ $#@ COMIC SANS #$%
@#$ $#@ But this is precisely the point someone buys it. #$%
@#$ $#@ To see the differences between versions of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whether its shit or not is immaterial. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ What exactly do you expect a game cover to do other than that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, maybe in 10 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well have PS4 emulation before PS3 emulation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Buyers remorse claims another victim. #$%
@#$ $#@ A cover needs to resemble some of the aspects of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The expression and visual style do not look like Silent Hill at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would fit a game with a Gothic theme maybe. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you reading right there, idiot? #$%
@#$ $#@ They're already booting commercial games, it's smooth sailing from there on. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gotta be honest, the Main character has better delivery in the HD version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everybody else is worse though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thts just my opinion after going through trying them both, james sounds like otacon , though i guess some people sound better in the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ a bunch of retarded faggots #$%
@#$ $#@ Nolan north did a terrible job as james #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats so incredibly incorrect I cant even think straight #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre too invested in the original to be objective. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was my only reply so yeah I guess #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not saying the new delivery is amazing, just that it's better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except its totally not #$%
@#$ $#@ They delete the shit for the harddrive space. #$%
@#$ $#@ You cant think clearly about it because of your earlier attachment. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disagree. #$%
@#$ $#@ the one character being THE main character, literally just groaning his lines to the mic, completely butchering at least one of the endings with the total "dude, chill out bro!" #$%
@#$ $#@ tone of voice, makes it even more pathetic. #$%
@#$ $#@ awkward =/= bad #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck these guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow of the Colossus was one of my favorite games but they fucked up Wanders ability to hold himself steady when climbing shaking colossi. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's laziness, that's all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill admit I only played the HD remakes of MGS 2-PW but they did an amazing job on those. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a strawman though, all Im saying is that one line I heard was better in the new delivery. #$%
@#$ $#@ get out moogleposter #$%
@#$ $#@ amateur mobile-app developers. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGS 3 runs like shit on PCSX2 and you have to use software mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why even lie about this? #$%
@#$ $#@ While I have zero knowledge of programming or coding, I feel like thats exactly the kind of problems they should be looking out for when remastering. #$%
@#$ $#@ can you explain how its bad without saying the word nostalgia? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a fair point and all, but there's really nothing they could have done about it without altering the code of the game, which is something Bluepoint is rather against when doing a remaster of a game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I suppose they could have made the framerate shittier on purpose, but I dont know how acceptable people would have found that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You probably would of had 4 and Origins too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disagree #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's because you're attached to the original. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any of the hand held ones spooky enough to play? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its because you just crave attention #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop replying, I wont miss you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just stop responding to him, jesus christ #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing has been proved #$%
@#$ $#@ Well like I said, they could have made the framerate shittier on purpose, but that might not have gone over very well for what most would consider a negligible thing or something most people wouldnt even notice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, I agree with you about it being worse in HD, but I also don't think it's unplayable or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's fine, it's just that the original was better because it had a worse framerate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ The guy is a faggot, I disagree with his shitty cocksucker opinion, but hes damn well entitled to have it. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want a circlejerk, fuck off back to reddit. #$%
@#$ $#@ no you've said from the beginning that the new ones are objectively better #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the Silent Hill HD collection the actual blunder of the century? #$%
@#$ $#@ the original VA sounds far more fitting, and "awkward" only on purpose. #$%
@#$ $#@ The HD versions lack any and all little hints of character nuances and hidden meanings behind the words. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, theres absolutely zero change of character in the Maria/Mary scene in the cell for example! #$%
@#$ $#@ no just a psychopath #$%
@#$ $#@ But its not that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im talking about the actual directors that told the actors to act the way they did. #$%
@#$ $#@ I recall reading there was the japanese cinematic director, but there was also a westerner who sat in to actually direct the actors to act how they did and that everything is the way it is becuase they wanted it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, prove it by not replying! #$%
@#$ $#@ No one is feeding excuses everyone is just knowledgeable about what the game is about and why these lines are delivered the way they are. #$%
@#$ $#@ None of the lines are delivered badly #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it the ideal way to play the games? #$%
@#$ $#@ But the PS3 version did get a patch and the games are perfectly playable despite frame rate drops here and there. #$%
@#$ $#@ People here like to massively overblow this topic. #$%
@#$ $#@ why are you responding #$%
@#$ $#@ Emulate or buy the originals off ebay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes I agree but they still provide an overall good horror game experience at a much lower cost than getting a PS2 and buying copies of the original versions. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a little behind on SH4, the 15fps cutscenes is fixed #$%
@#$ $#@ playing the PC versions or emulating offer the lowest cost actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disagree. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fuck ups in the audio and visuals greatly hinder the overall experience. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont have PS2 by now, which you really should, pirate the goddamn PC ports. #$%
@#$ $#@ I personally dont do pirating. #$%
@#$ $#@ But yeah, it is the cheapest way. #$%
@#$ $#@ you are really really craving attention arent you #$%
@#$ $#@ How easy is it to get them running on Windows 7 though? #$%
@#$ $#@ I could say the same thing, frankly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt Troy Baker a part of the original Team Silent? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt James Sunderland modeled off of Troy Baker before he was a voice actor? #$%
@#$ $#@ Call me a pleb if you want but fuck that. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I want is to just easily play the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The HD collection provides that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it sucks that Konami didnt give a shit about doing it right but I played through both SH2 and 3 on PS3 and still enjoyed myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bought it used by the way. #$%
@#$ $#@ From a locally owned game store near me, not GameStop. #$%
@#$ $#@ You didnt notice the horrifically bad textures? #$%
@#$ $#@ Troy Baker and Laura Bailey? #$%
@#$ $#@ Severe framerate drops and slowdowns? #$%
@#$ $#@ The voice acting didn't bother me because I hadn't played the originals in like 10 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I did notice some of the bad textures and frame rate drops but it wasnt game breaking for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im no purist but I immediately noticed shit like Heather turning into Donte. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree its a problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm just saying it wasn't a total deal breaker for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was still able to complete both games and still found them enjoyable. #$%
@#$ $#@ So the Silent Hill 1 download is for a PS emulator? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, like I said, I hadnt played the PS2 versions in 10 years or so. #$%
@#$ $#@ I sold my PS2 and all my old games years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Huge mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a real shame about the Silent Hill collection because every other HD collection on PS3 is a great value and the best way to experience the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ The underlying quality of the games still shines through in the PS3 version at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Obviously people that are intimately familiar with the PS2 originals are going to nitpick every little problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im personally not going to care all that much that some of the sound files are different or some fog is missing. #$%
@#$ $#@ The patch for the PS3 version addresses the majority of the big issues. #$%
@#$ $#@ My spirit lives. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see just more shitposting #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes and I stand by my statement. #$%
@#$ $#@ For someone that has never played the PS2 originals or hasn't played them in years, the post-patch PS3 version plays well enough and the underlying quality of the games is good enough that they'll be able to enjoy them just fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ That said, I do wish they gave you the option to switch to the original voice track for SH3 like they do for SH2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats an odd choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ We dont know anything really about it yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ B-but its Mario #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats cause its not just cropped, thats an unfinished preview, or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know I loved Mario Tennis 64 and Mario Power Tennis for GC, what else do I need to know? #$%
@#$ $#@ that it might not be worth $50 and could be as watered down as Open. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like for the gameplay to enhance what was put in Power Tennis, or just see something else besides mega mushrooms. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually felt like Power Tennis emphasized abilities/effects too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ In 64 characters like Boo, Paratrooper, Koopa Troopa had unique enough shots/movement styles to keep it interesting without so much reliance on gimmicks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard plastic analog stick nearly bloodied my thumbs playing that thing though. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty much this #$%
@#$ $#@ People played on Normal when ZUN said he designed the game on Easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nerfing the demo fights #$%
@#$ $#@ I would, but I am of usa. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess Ill never play again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who does this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, Touhou is videogames #$%
@#$ $#@ who did he used? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm the one who you are replaying and I think calling it more gimmicky than UFO is an stretch since it changes the way you are playing the game form "dodge and kill"to "catch the UFO while dodging and killing, if you are a fraction of a second late then say goodbye to your stack", plus if you get a dialogue scene then the UFO dissapears #$%
@#$ $#@ bring it on #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking get good and graze #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah Junko should have used more of those lasers instead of just HIGH SPEED CIRCLES OF BULLET WITH LITTLE SPACE IN BETWEEN #$%
@#$ $#@ You can beat LoLK by playing normally the same way you can beat UFO by playing normally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marisa's and Reisen's bad endings are the most accepted to be canon though #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that a man? #$%
@#$ $#@ Crush that faget with the superior toohoo, Sakuya #$%
@#$ $#@ T here are chapters in Stage 3 that are the SAME SHIT as Extra stage with no changes at all, unlike, lets say, PCB Extra and Phantasm #$%
@#$ $#@ Whos he maining? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only good things were Youmu and the music #$%
@#$ $#@ I was talking exclusively about the SA callbacks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right about the Extra, that was inexcusable bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ One enemy even appears offscreen and sits there for a while before moving. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did 1cc of it on lunatic on first try. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent played it since. #$%
@#$ $#@ are you blind? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not #$%
@#$ $#@ ulil barely works on windows #$%
@#$ $#@ DLL and environment checks, because because Tasofro really doesnt want people modifying their game this time around. #$%
@#$ $#@ i liked it but it was too hard to get lives and i haed playing as marisa and youmu #$%
@#$ $#@ Good games #$%
@#$ $#@ How good are you #$%
@#$ $#@ I would join #$%
@#$ $#@ Bring the salt #$%
@#$ $#@ I would play ULiL, but it sucks without a roll. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is not a netplay thread #$%
@#$ $#@ Then how come you werent bitching when someone was playing ULiL? #$%
@#$ $#@ Please stop shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ san japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ Who says so? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you really wanna bring that kind of people back then fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you enjoy your impending doom. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not even the guy you were playing with #$%
@#$ $#@ I would prefer people playing videogames rather than 100% funposting #$%
@#$ $#@ No, metaposts like yours are why those threads died, kindly fuck off before you kill this one too. #$%
@#$ $#@ They got DRM #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a nonBaidu link for this game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, I'd be fine with DRM if they'd sell their games digitally already. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still cant get it to not map both players to one gamepad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its suffering. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing to spectate apart from the waiting for opponents screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could stream but thats effort. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can buy it off playisms jp site if you really want it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not really great compared to Bose's main RPGs so it might not be worth playing unless you know a little Japanese or really want to play an RPG starring Marisa. #$%
@#$ $#@ I find it difficult to time when the game isnt running at 100% speed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Itd probably look like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ What if ZUN sells the touhou franchise to Konami? #$%
@#$ $#@ Touhou re-release on Pachinko #$%
@#$ $#@ Yet you get me on the dish merry-go-round armor #$%
@#$ $#@ Its better than TD and UFO. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yo, wanna play PoFV or ULiL? #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminder that Banpai Akira is basically a slave now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Still hosting ULiL but I can do either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, Ill join you in ULiL once I get home, then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then try a meatier attack like j5a, 6a or 66a/66b instead of just a jab #$%
@#$ $#@ Drive safe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Moonware is an upgrade over that slut. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you even talking about, with trial and error gameplay i was reffering to LoLK which it is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I'm playing with a XBOX controller, so I have no fucking clue what you're saying to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you you cant tell me what to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks good. #$%
@#$ $#@ It reminds me of the font used for lewd mangas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sagume has no horns, therefore she is inferior. #$%
@#$ $#@ Could be better but okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone post the horned 2hu clubhouse picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rude, dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ And you can exchange a few words with Seija. #$%
@#$ $#@ Font sucks and Marisa is not a southerner. #$%
@#$ $#@ Y'gotta problem wit' that, partner? #$%
@#$ $#@ W...what is happening? #$%
@#$ $#@ kuso font, change it #$%
@#$ $#@ There are plenty of tomboys in the world who dont live in the southern United States, just listen to one of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marisa found something interesting at Kourindou. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use contractions and have her speak in a somewhat impolite tone. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, like the opposite of what the Dragon Ball Z dub did with Frieza. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tell them to change that ugly font. #$%
@#$ $#@ im trying but there's too many buttkissers #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, it looks way too blocky. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use something more curvy, more girly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I kind of like it, it looks very manga esque, which is what I think the game was going for. #$%
@#$ $#@ any suggestions? #$%
@#$ $#@ My entire problem with that font is the lack of lowercase letters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just find something that has them, I don't care if it's otherwise the exact same font. #$%
@#$ $#@ are you the guy who suggested we use papyrus and comic sans? #$%
@#$ $#@ Use Soberana Sans #$%
@#$ $#@ fixed that for you #$%
@#$ $#@ heck yes #$%
@#$ $#@ Used to be when the threads were up, but the archive is rip and I cant find it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You forgot about Junko being behind the scenes of the Youkai-Lunarian War, making it possible for the Lunarians to win, but since they killed her son she developed a huge lust for revenge and she wants to eliminate the MoonRunes by using Hellparasities, making everyone that writes in MoonRunes to die instantly #$%
@#$ $#@ SAmireko pls contain your autism #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, if youre going to be this much of an autist then do what thcrap was made for and make a patch that replaces all of Marisas lines to whatever doesnt trigger you. #$%
@#$ $#@ You actually took time in paint just for this shitty meme? #$%
@#$ $#@ Her son is probably in heaven by now if he were to be in the netherworld anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ what is she gonna do, kill her? #$%
@#$ $#@ She would just cermon her but it would fall into deaf ears since Shiki has no authority against Mokou #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon, you dont go to Heaven from the Netherworld, the Netherworld is the place youre sent to when you werent good enough for Heaven but not sinful enough for Hell either. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes you do, you cant do that NOW, but before you could achieve Nirvana and go to Heaven, and certainly that includes the time her son has been dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or where you wait for your judgement #$%
@#$ $#@ Did we desync? #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre kinda just sitting there. #$%
@#$ $#@ And now it's just black screen so I guess that's a yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I need to do some shit in a few anyway, so Im gonna say good games and maybe host PoFV in an hour, hour and a half. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, it looked like a desynch. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is no way in hell that Heaven was closed off since Houyi fucked around, if it was people wouldn't even have the need to inform others that they can't do it anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant you just reach Heaven by just flying like in SWR? #$%
@#$ $#@ People parroting the opinions of high-level players, who cant even beat Junko. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then theres really no point in having her go. #$%
@#$ $#@ orin would be perfect for this #$%
@#$ $#@ Just like Futo #$%
@#$ $#@ She goes Rorouni Kenshin? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt the guy asking for Futo to go tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ So TD but in Hell? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, I don't think DDC's ost was super great. #$%
@#$ $#@ But its pretty good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it is a full DMC thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt know about the danmaku segment. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Almost everything #$%
@#$ $#@ Since when Yuyuko is a newhu? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or are you talking about unnamed spirit? #$%
@#$ $#@ LoLK was fun, the hate meme is getting out of hand. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off, this is not a netplay thread #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck them too, they almost filled this thread with metaposting about how to play the game #$%
@#$ $#@ So much edge. #$%
@#$ $#@ That reason is because people here would rather shitpost than actually play videogames. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, if you want to shitpost, go back to /jp/. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont belong here. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the fucking videogames board you dense fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4.5 months if I remember correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sorry, I didn't realize I posted Remilia twice in a row, and if it bothers your autism so much I'll be sure it doesn't happen again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Adonis 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might have to pause at some point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might not, but fair warning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then make yourself a thread for netplay, stop fucking crying about something 3 guys want to do in a thread where it's not gonna happen #$%
@#$ $#@ They are fine as long as they dont circlejerking. #$%
@#$ $#@ These namefags are fine if they stop being namefags. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know very well it would just end up with the same shitflingers causing trouble. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny how you say that and still expect some netplay here where the shitflingers are in their natural state #$%
@#$ $#@ Good games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id forgotten how soupy 7 delay is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the matches! #$%
@#$ $#@ It's really nice seeing that you're still here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought you left a couple of weeks ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Couple months ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ I skim the threads once in a while, but largely avoid them these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess thats to be expected, with how toxic these threads have become. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, whatever, I hope Ill see you again another time! #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to wait a Comiket or Reitaisai after a Touhou release for porn of new Touhous. #$%
@#$ $#@ The futanari wasn't bad, but the puking killed me #$%
@#$ $#@ DID SOMEONE SAY KANCOLLE #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you already have a thread to shitpost in? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know, what would happen if Daiyousei met not-Benben? #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont look at me, I took the pic from the wiki and they had it labeled like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to loot Murasss booty. #$%
@#$ $#@ what a bunch of nerds #$%
@#$ $#@ no she browses 2chan #$%
@#$ $#@ How long ago was Sanae pulled out of the real world? #$%
@#$ $#@ it cant have been that long ago if she was a highschool girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I suppose even someone from the 90s would be surprised by the growth of things like smartphones and the Internet. #$%
@#$ $#@ And /r9k/, /v/, and maybe /a/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Every eleven on /int/ is just Sumireko being a xenophobic bitch with a very tenuous grasp on the English language. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2007, maybe 2006. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not every thread have to reach bump limit, you retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop that #$%
@#$ $#@ No, responding to obvious shitposting #$%
@#$ $#@ What about /jp/? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, I don't think Sumi's THAT much of a loser. #$%
@#$ $#@ If /jp/ actually talk about Japanese culture including rumors, yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only waifufags and perverted neckbeards will give a shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I like generic pop shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It all sounds like the same shit, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just have shit taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, YOU have shit taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ It all sounds the same because its too deep for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least it wasnt Eurobeat #$%
@#$ $#@ whats wrong with that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds the same #$%
@#$ $#@ shit taste pleb #$%
@#$ $#@ You have a point, Eurobeat is even more obnoxious. #$%
@#$ $#@ speaking of which, why was her battle sprite just a fuzzy ball when everyone else had a full body? #$%
@#$ $#@ I have absolutely no idea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not complaining though, the AI get hit by its hitbox somewhat often when it leaves the screen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me source on that picture because I am calling bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing Neets have is time anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Repeat everything back to you #$%
@#$ $#@ i don't get it why is she a dinosaur #$%
@#$ $#@ no ones talking about boats, why are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ No its not, shut the fuck up you shitposter. #$%
@#$ $#@ no, these threads can do just fine without boats #$%
@#$ $#@ Silly Cirno, she torched herself to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, there's that earthbound like game, but I've only heard bad things about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ whens someone going to make a danmakufu of undertale battles? #$%
@#$ $#@ I might give it a try then, but Ive never played Earthbound though. #$%
@#$ $#@ you should play earthbound first, you'll appreciate the references more and i think it spoils a bit #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah ok, I dont really care about that kind of nitpicks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not just any fire, Hellfire. #$%
@#$ $#@ but how would the platforming sections be translated into 2hu? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only earthbound? #$%
@#$ $#@ What about the other two mother games? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mother 3 is also relevant. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aya with a mix of Mamizou but in 3D #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotcha, thanks guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Old by now #$%
@#$ $#@ not as dead as marisa #$%
@#$ $#@ Good in UFO? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to try her out but I'm not sure if she's any good. #$%
@#$ $#@ AOE attacks that kill everything in the screen, also a bomb that kills everything in the screen that gives you 5~7 seconds of invulnerability. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what, Sanae A or B? #$%
@#$ $#@ The snakes are Sanae A. #$%
@#$ $#@ So what youre telling me is that Suwako &gt; Kanako in this case? #$%
@#$ $#@ That the japs should learn English and make a translation to sell them to not only Japan so I can buy them #$%
@#$ $#@ for what purpose are they even there? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, suwako is better, but it feels too easy its somewhat boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only good for memes #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon, UFO is kicking my ass so I dont feel too guilty about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes a dumb lazy Irish Leprechaun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hello /jp/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, you have to fight Benben Tsukumo, the inferior sister. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the bump fam. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, one look at /jp/ makes me want to say yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the /jp/ kind, and I mean the current /jp/. #$%
@#$ $#@ All those Rad Futo memes and just look at Ichirin, she doesnt even have to try to look cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how you see that /jp/ has changed with new kids latched into its memes, just like reddit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im impressed that /jp/ managed to get worse since the last time I looked at it, which was like 3 weeks ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ PLAY BALL! #$%
@#$ $#@ jesus christ this fucking game really takes me back, the powerups in that game were pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ my favorites were the ones that would make the ball curve all over the place when you hit it and the lighting pitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Street v2 is objectively better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this the one where you have to skate over a helicopter? #$%
@#$ $#@ CAN I SCREAM #$%
@#$ $#@ That isn't NBA homecourt #$%
@#$ $#@ my niggah #$%
@#$ $#@ V3 was really fucking popular anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people I know probably played that more than V2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is anakin on the cover? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont really care about the popularity of the game but rather the quality. #$%
@#$ $#@ V3 had very little. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im glad you and your friends had fun playing a bad game, but that has little to do with anything related to what I posted. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit, I barely played Street vol.2 I only rented it a couple times so then I got Street V3. #$%
@#$ $#@ which I think they are good games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But just hearing this song made me nostalgia so fucking hard because that little that I played, I remember going through the menus picking MJ. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I need to get this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love that game, in fact the only football game I like, used to play after high school with my friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ The third game was so fucking disappointing. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can hate EA as much as you want, but you have to give them credit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They make the best sports games around #$%
@#$ $#@ Nba street 2 is the best sports game to ever come out #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay but when are we getting Mutant League Football again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed, so fucking cozy, we used to play on a rented xbox in a cybercafe near school. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were definitely a lot more arcadey with more features, and not trying to be perfect simulators that focuses more on graphics than gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember Here comes the Pain #$%
@#$ $#@ It still is if you have friends to play it with, have you tried the new one? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit nigga almost forgot about that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ My brother and I would not stop talking shit after fucking the others play and body slamming our players #$%
@#$ $#@ Blitz the League 1 and 2 theyre extremely fun and the story modes are great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad some fucking 12 year old fucked up the wiki, been meaning to get around to fixing that but I need to rebuy the guide for the first game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean that ripoff of the superior AKI game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the GC one any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ Where in my post did I say NFL, I was referring to APF2K8, but seriously for 2K5 people have made updated roster mods for 360 its great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, all the Tennis games handheld variations are superior just because they come with a Custom Character Campaign mode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Meanwhile the console ones just have 3D graphics in return for no Custom Character Campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ M8 I don't care about campaigns I'm looking for something to play with buddies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fun, but Undisputed 3 is the best by far. #$%
@#$ $#@ More attacks and customization. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus fuckin Pride rules. #$%
@#$ $#@ YOU CAN SOCCER KICK NIGGAS IN THE HEAD WHEN THEY ARE DOWN #$%
@#$ $#@ The gc version is hella fun with buddies #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright thanks, Ill put it on my list. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bruce Lee is pretty OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's fun shit, and they actually made him do his hilarious noises when he attacks #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not even that big of a deal because it make for some cool spots but they just feel less natural. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does the Trials series count? #$%
@#$ $#@ RISING TO THE STREET #$%
@#$ $#@ that game was badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I used to play the fuck out of that game during sleepovers, I need to make a list of gamecube games I need to buy again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck, Im pretty sure most games cube sports games are on the cheap, but everything else is going up in price quick, make your list quick and snatch those games up as soon as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ There will probably be a new one in a couple years, it sells well enough to have more games but not well enough to be consistent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus I must have had 100 hours played, it was amazing #$%
@#$ $#@ Should I buy Metroid Prime for $10? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope its just a golf game with a killer ost #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasn't even the best injury just most comical best injuries were shattered hip and spinal cord contusion #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing Ar noSurge. #$%
@#$ $#@ The battle system is fun but I wish there were more skills feels a bit repetitive.Looking forward to Xenoblade Chronicles X #$%
@#$ $#@ XCX isnt out yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it released a month ago? #$%
@#$ $#@ Close enough, because where else are you going to talk about it, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ The last remnant is kinda like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ The horror stories are because of the shit you mentioned anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im playing through 1 right now and I got through the tutorial. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just wondering what classes to use for my first playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of 1? #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on what youre going for. #$%
@#$ $#@ IIRC any class can max any stat, endgame-wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise just have fun and do what you like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Disgaea is a game about hitting first and hitting hard as endgame-wise you can assume every action to be a OHKO, especially in 3 and beyond. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to have me some fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ That said, I think the Majin class is the only one that can MAX EVERYTHING but you can still start now using whatever generic you want for that, and reincarnate into a Majin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is the Angel of Valhalla from Lightning Returns the most badass chocobo ever? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant tell you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent even finished 2 yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im on hour 94 of this trainwreck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do all JRPGs have similar looking UIs? #$%
@#$ $#@ Prolly to avoid the shit you see in WRPGs like FUCKING CASUALIZED UI and the like, you know? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why fix whats not broken? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder the same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really like it, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It still kills me that most ps3/vita jrpgs use that shitty built in save system. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok man calm down I get it #$%
@#$ $#@ Calm down? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did I come off as mad or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just meant that WRPGs get all sorts of shit for their UIs all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont mind it one bit myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ You started writing in all caps #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time I made one was Tuesday, buddy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not the only one who makes these threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ but the holocaust never happened #$%
@#$ $#@ How did you add color to Undertale #$%
@#$ $#@ All older woman want ss,all girls think youre a loser though,add dude bros and beta kids,base boss dialogue on famous quotes from political figures. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're mom should talk like billy mays and you're party should talk like the ninja turtles #$%
@#$ $#@ answer is 2, isn't it #$%
@#$ $#@ How did you get 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ I might be retarded I can't see any pattern in that #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what I got. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 right? #$%
@#$ $#@ This was bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is basically the definition of GUIDE REQUIRED. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you adding them together? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you are the pattern doesn't hold up #$%
@#$ $#@ Goddamn I am retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ How to restore honor? #$%
@#$ $#@ its not about being a child or not, its about knowing that 90% of number based logic tests arent math but tricks and visual patterns. #$%
@#$ $#@ The highest math theyll try is something like y=2x+1 or Fibonacci. #$%
@#$ $#@ The rest is kid magazine tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ by realizing that this "puzzle" didnt require any actual thinking, only the unlearning of numbers, numbers that has put us into a modern society #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck this riddle seriously #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked this one from The Testament of Sherlock Holmes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm selling these fine leather jackets #$%
@#$ $#@ I got a BSOD when my hard drive died #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly cant remember. #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent got that screen in many years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bioshock Infinite. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also made me notice that CCC put my GPU-fan on max 30% if set on "auto". #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time i saw bluescreen was in 2002 when my RAM started dying on me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even in the grim darkness of the far future, Windows still reigns. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fucking music. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know what problem was, at a time i played that game like crazy, but my PC would turn off and to start it up i had to slightly pick up the case and smack it on the floor couple times to make it work again. #$%
@#$ $#@ It worked - really, damn i was a stupid kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, my PSU did output enough power, but after the whole sparkling, it was the only part which was actually burned and didnt work afterwards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt know at the time it was some cheap China shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ That reminds me how my friend when connecting MY FUCKING screen to an old dell 486 case connected VGAit was CRT cable upside down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Screen flickered couple times and died. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grand Theft Auto V because its a shit port. #$%
@#$ $#@ A psu can give you wildly out of spec power if you get a cheap one and load it too high. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nvidia driver never requires restart when updating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent restarted in months. #$%
@#$ $#@ the cctv screens look like eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its not needed since win7. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modded Skyrim before I upgraded my PC #$%
@#$ $#@ The last time I saw a BSOD when my friend tried to install ubuntu on his PC around 6 years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go away. #$%
@#$ $#@ her aroused face really creeps me out #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, thats also her drunk face, so maybe that has something to do with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the HD resolution fam #$%
@#$ $#@ CHIE IS THE BEST I'LL KILL YOU #$%
@#$ $#@ I would have if you didnt say Rise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you just beg to be derided. #$%
@#$ $#@ She can be a little dorky sometimes but yeah, she's got moves #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the worst game on the PS Vita #$%
@#$ $#@ how come Risefags and Naotofags are always the chillest people here? #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the best game on the PS Vita #$%
@#$ $#@ I just wish that anyone that wasnt Yu, Rise, or Nanako got more than 1-2 songs to dance to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially Chie, Margaret, and Naoto. #$%
@#$ $#@ LITERALLY PERFECT #$%
@#$ $#@ There's an option to dim the background if that's troubling you #$%
@#$ $#@ I am super thankful that you got the option to mute the Note and Scratch sound FX. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game is garbage, what do you expect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time I see this video I am mesmerized. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that parts of the song align perfectly with Nanaokos movements still blows me away. #$%
@#$ $#@ I must admit, the slow reveal of the nature of Kanamis trauma was well done. #$%
@#$ $#@ she dances like a turkey #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats how music works dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ If two songs have the same time signature then beats will match up. #$%
@#$ $#@ this isn't a very good sync, he's too busy #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its the flair the headband provides that really brings the whole outfit together. #$%
@#$ $#@ damn he kinda does #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats some JSRF flair right there. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks good in it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are the DLC costumes fully scanned somewhere? #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone fully scanned the art book and put the whole thing on g.e-hentai. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what the Velvet Room Loli Twins are for. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kanji muh fuckn bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything he does is gold in my eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ that outfit and those moves just make it look like he's completely rolling #$%
@#$ $#@ As stiff as his dance was I think his were some of the better synced ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the name for that style of dancing that convulses to dub step? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I think that's what Kanji's doing in his solo performances. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is only 1 answer to this question #$%
@#$ $#@ the other idol, i'd imagine #$%
@#$ $#@ He moved to the music when he could, acted out some of the lyrics, and had that really neat foot tapping bit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well of COURSE he can dance. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what they say about black folk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Atlus is just tuning up the band so they can say Nyarly was behind everything in P3 and P4 and played us all like fiddles.....AGAIN! #$%
@#$ $#@ the thigh game crazy #$%
@#$ $#@ Because when she's dancing she's not saying autistic sperg comments or laughing like a hyena. #$%
