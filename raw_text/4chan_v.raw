@#$ $#@ Previous thread, died, RIP lore dump. #$%
@#$ $#@ look up puyovs it's free and online #$%
@#$ $#@ We should just start a puyo general. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post more ess #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is that fish such a dick? #$%
@#$ $#@ Make it #$%
@#$ $#@ It will die. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can play Puyo Puyo Fever on PC and Puyo Puyo Tetris with Cemu RPC 3 or Citra. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good thing we know that Satan marrying Arle when she turns 20 is not canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who knew a puzzle game could have such fucked up lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bokukko are a thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes I am well learned in that topic #$%
@#$ $#@ How powerful are the magical adults? #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't Arle's mom supposed to be a super magician or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ When youre the best, you can be a dick to whoever you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has a mom? #$%
@#$ $#@ Schezo was decapitated by a 16 year old Arle though, so its okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ She didnt even really get phased by him still being alive after that. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Compile did use the lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Amities voices are great because her regular voice is nicely delivered while her alt voice is actually alt and not a straight up superior version or the actor sounding like a retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heck her ladylike alt voice is actually an idea pulled straight from the story which is another point in its favor. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was Segas fault for the shit that happened with Puyo Monogatari. #$%
@#$ $#@ This shit is good to listen to while playing online matches. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should I emulate old Puyo games? #$%
@#$ $#@ The arcade versions of Puyo 1&amp;2 are going to be on fightcade by the end of the year, as well as some other puyo spinoffs like Nazo Puyo and Robotniks Mean Bean Machine. #$%
@#$ $#@ I managed to make my first 6 chain albeit with a degree of luck right after reading it, so Id say it was pretty useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks a bunch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make it Eggman instead and we have a deal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is the 'girl' with the hairy ears? #$%
@#$ $#@ purple hair cutest #$%
@#$ $#@ I think theyre cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ arle is a fucking Godslayer in the older games #$%
@#$ $#@ This artstyle is so easy to imitate, I cant tell whats an official picture or not unless its got something lewd in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That boss theme is pretty catchy #$%
@#$ $#@ Its also possible that a lot of this is coming from their mobile game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only in the PC-98 version of the game though. #$%
@#$ $#@ So it was Segas fault for fucking up Madou Monogatari? #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the Fever artstyle when it was thicker lines and flat colors. #$%
@#$ $#@ It especially helped those games keep their own identity when they were trying to be a successor to Puyo Puyo instead of just dragging its legacy along with itself. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't care for the 20th Anniversary art shift, and I care for Chronicle's even less. #$%
@#$ $#@ they are compileheart and shit out weebshit shovelware now #$%
@#$ $#@ They literally did die, but then came back a few years afterwards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Financial problems or something, they stretched themselves too thin and went bankrupt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks I'll keep this in mind I'm still having a ton of trouble recognizing patterns I think I just need to practice more. #$%
@#$ $#@ why the fuck does it come with a bib #$%
@#$ $#@ *mystery dungeon game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does she have a loose belt? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im fine with a mediocre dungeon crawler if it got a good story. #$%
@#$ $#@ What about a great dungeon crawler with an absolutely abysmal story? #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember when people made fun of Atlus by calling them "Fatlus". #$%
@#$ $#@ What makes modern Compile so bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ooops, sorry, wrong pic #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ MMHM SMASH! #$%
@#$ $#@ Lidelle, Dongearu, and Onion Pixie, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes just self-destructive. #$%
@#$ $#@ they should also make socks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id buy that for a dollar! #$%
@#$ $#@ mom doesn't allow shoes in the house america #$%
@#$ $#@ The real question is: what is the first thing to break? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well at least theres a proper warning about that cancer on the door. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess I´ll be playing 4.1 for another year until I can play it on PC #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd assume theyd announce a PC release, didnt 4.1 do fairly well? #$%
@#$ $#@ and wasnt actually really well optimized for a Japanese PC port? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just figured that would be a nice way to make the new iteration feel fresh without much extra effort. #$%
@#$ $#@ Double Lysander or af99st +w/e gets stale after a decade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill admit playing solo air raider and fencer did spice things up in terms of variety. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, Sandlot gets like, a total of 8 dollars to make these games #$%
@#$ $#@ can sb explain to me why this game is so great? #$%
@#$ $#@ i played edf4.1 and thought it was utter trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ wonky gameplay shit graphics, grind. #$%
@#$ $#@ wtf is this im not seeing #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyll probably wait until theyve gotten as much money as they can from the PS4 version to port it, but wasnt the PC version done by XSEED? #$%
@#$ $#@ oh and the sound my god was it annoying at times, especially when those flying girl got cought in webs or were attacked #$%
@#$ $#@ On a basic level, its a fun coop game that allows you to do combined arms military/toku larping with a lot of room for emergent gameplay and variance. #$%
@#$ $#@ On a higher level, its a pretty good successor to games like smash TV and gain ground, where the basic gameplay is quite simple but a lot of depth comes from enemy placement and composition. #$%
@#$ $#@ The details of the units are a step back from DoW 2, but the buildings for the orkz are top-tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ i wouldnt ask /v/ if you want a well written response. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im enjoying it but what do i know, im just a shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, you fuck off, shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ And take your 2 cents with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im really not liking the campaign so far. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im only up to mission 4 though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss wargear, and the elite persistent upgrade and army doctrine thing kind of sucks though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wait for starcraft HD in a month and play with /vg/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for correcting the record, for the record. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was talking about how early game is about 3 or more squad running around the battlefield which is exactly the case with all squad based Relic games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course they do not play the same but that shit has been around since DoW1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now it's fuck load more lethal since you can't reinforce on the spot and Unit die with a sneeze. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, and unlike previous Relic games except DoW1, btw, which people like to pretend is somehow like 3, there are no gameplay mechanics to support this running around. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no cover, no morale, no pinning, no prone position, no fucking nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ So again its like Relic games in the abstract sense of low unit counts in early game, but not really in any direct gameplay similarity. #$%
@#$ $#@ The artstyle/graphics for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, that is stupid, but the other 2 were held back by technology at the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ DOW3 looks like fucking DOTA or LOL and there is no excuse other than it was intentional. #$%
@#$ $#@ It should be gritty and dark... #$%
@#$ $#@ also the focus on "competitive online play" is what has ruined the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sergey The Hedgehog #$%
@#$ $#@ That's really just a Shadow recolor I'd say. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didn't put way too much effort into it like mine #$%
@#$ $#@ same poster forgot to type. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's the only I fond when I searched #$%
@#$ $#@ well whats your name Dongus? #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually not too bad desu #$%
@#$ $#@ why the fuck did I read all that #$%
@#$ $#@ Mine is spelled OR, how many Ns you got there Conner/Coner? #$%
@#$ $#@ buying gf #$%
@#$ $#@ NO OOOOOONNNNEEEEE... #$%
@#$ $#@ well that's pretty odd #$%
@#$ $#@ Time to die. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just how edgy and/or stupid were your parents to name you Shadow? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it's safe to say atleast 40% of sonic OC's are done ironically now #$%
@#$ $#@ This one has to be fake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your parents named you Sonic? #$%
@#$ $#@ SHIPS MY OC #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't decide between the two #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh jesus #$%
@#$ $#@ POST IT YOU FAGGOT #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK WHY DID I KEEP LOOKING #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, shit I forgot the image. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait, so is austin british or is his fauther #$%
@#$ $#@ Well by rule of bloodline both would be... #$%
@#$ $#@ But apparently both some sort of lightning village, Great Möbius, and most Earth cities exist in this childs mind as all three are mentioned. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting way too deep into this arent I? #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay you win. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, your name is still Edgar... #$%
@#$ $#@ posting other ones too #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you drink a video game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, beat me to it #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty good actually #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus fucking christ #$%
@#$ $#@ oh no it's retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ hi pewds #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi Tiffany! #$%
@#$ $#@ Please, post the full thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am too invested in this story to have it cut off like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear to God Im naming a kid Danteroth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill fucking adopt if I have to. #$%
@#$ $#@ the worst one #$%
@#$ $#@ This is why youre suffering. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but only with a friend who lives in the same town as me. #$%
@#$ $#@ If we are talking about online then yeah, I still play with my friends back in my senior but they pretty much only play LoL and one of them plays TF2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything is correct except for a job. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats Nico doing in an objectively shittier show? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is having a family and job really that bad at where you are living or is it just because of your own experience with your family? #$%
@#$ $#@ Silly, that isnt Steven Universe. #$%
@#$ $#@ We broke up over local politics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck politics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much every day. #$%
@#$ $#@ You do remind me of my classmate back in highschool. #$%
@#$ $#@ He just sat at that one table alone and whenever we call him to join us he will look at us like we are some sort of goons then he will just walk away. #$%
@#$ $#@ We just dont want him to be left out but he always tries to avoid socializing people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you happen to be betrayed or have bad experience that prevents tou from socializing,anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because I dont even like the games they play now and I have a PS4 to play with my other friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont like talking to people. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt even heavily bullied or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ I legitimately don't have anything to say and it's easier to just be alone instead of trying to force it. #$%
@#$ $#@ can you even rip ps3 models? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, im here about the eternal Zelenin Concert tickets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why wouldnt you be able to? #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn it Windows, don't move the icons on my desktop around when I'm trying to select one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can't wait to see how Atlus USA manage to fuck up pronouncing everyone's names. #$%
@#$ $#@ this fucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ the first time I found him he immediatly STONEd me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zelenin and Jimenez are the best Law and Chaos Heroes in the whole series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Goddamnit anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Walter and Jonathon are the short bus of Law and Chaos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait until V. #$%
@#$ $#@ P5 was just the start of the glorious HD demon models. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd like to get deep in her journey if you know what I mean #$%
@#$ $#@ How big is she supposed to be? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id hump it. #$%
@#$ $#@ FAILURE OF A HUMAN #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd hump anything at this point anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eat your Magatamas, build Str and buff shit up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get used to the dated RNG fusion system. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep the Pixie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually you can fuse the Pixie away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just don't sacrifice her #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rather have Hua Po and Pixie hump me. #$%
@#$ $#@ which demon is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ They basically just get eaten like 5 minutes after finally embracing their LAW/CHAOS duties after their alignements being in the back burner for the whole game, meanwhile J goes demon to save a Bugabro and Z is basically tricked into becoming the LAW Popstar because no one explained to her that angels are ALSO demons in SMT after PTSD, both are retards who abandon the mission tho but i like the way they fall into their alignments, Jimenez goes Chaos due his compassion to what is actually a weakling, Zelenin clings to Law out of fear, they arent THE CHOSEN TO BE FUSION MATERIAL like in IV, just normal people. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know about str since demifiend punches shit, but how much should I upgrade the rest? #$%
@#$ $#@ Cap everything at 30 because the final magatama gives you +10 to all stats except Luck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear, I am wary as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whenever there is an extra ending in SMT games it completely misses the point of the original game and invalidates fucking everything else and the end result isnt even better. #$%
@#$ $#@ STR and only STR. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially if you go true demon because Freikugel #$%
@#$ $#@ people are speculating that the new girl is actually just Amon right? #$%
@#$ $#@ They missed their chance in IV twice to make him a special costume. #$%
@#$ $#@ VIT, AGI and STR to 30. #$%
@#$ $#@ Luck is complete useless dont touch it. #$%
@#$ $#@ 8th day was good #$%
@#$ $#@ People seem to like the TDE in Nocturne #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you say that Survivor Overclocked is a exception that did it right with giving every ending a extension instead of adding a new one? #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn, this sure looks unfun to draw #$%
@#$ $#@ magics for pussies, when I play this kind of shit I go agility and Strength and Fist of the North Star my way through bitches. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, but it middle fingers the entire plot of the game, the Reasons, True Freedom ending, sexual tensions with the teacher. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least were getting SMTV on Switch with HD Models. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt be surprised if we start getting a big influx of spinoff games like we did on PS2 because of the new models to reuse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nocturne was on the PS2 my man. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was 3 gens ago #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats your point? #$%
@#$ $#@ Times change #$%
@#$ $#@ Times change how? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Devil Survivors is a SRPG, think FFTactics, DDS is basically Nocturne but more "traditionally" with a set party and a "sphere grid" for learning skills instead of demon recruitment and fusion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gameplay-wise DDS is basically Nocturne but instead of demons, you are given a sphere grid-like system for your characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Devil Survivor is a strategy RPG and is a whole new beast. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry guys, I meant more in tone. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know the gameplay differences but nothing about the stories. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay this is what I was looking for. #$%
@#$ $#@ I k ow you are part of a crew in DDS but it doesnt seem like they have that much of a personality basing this off of seeing like 10 minutes of gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks all. #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT on 3DS is VERY fast as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt have finished the PS2 games without a fast forward button. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona 5 already has 191 personas for the player character, any future game is only going to add more demons. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is a good reason for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you worry. #$%
@#$ $#@ More like optional boss package for only 5.99 + tip like IV. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres less, unfortunately. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have no idea m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly don't know if I like Serph's, Hero's, or Raidou's design better #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, yeah, he is Bufu specialized. #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona doesnt deserve Squilliam. #$%
@#$ $#@ COMPs are the best, but i think Hero looks better before the timeskip. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry, Roland is better anyway, i'd worry more about fucking up getting the special skills. #$%
@#$ $#@ That actually sounds fun but we will probably only get Persona 5 Warriors during the Persona 5 milking period #$%
@#$ $#@ Better character maybe, but Heat is obviously the better option in terms of the story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not starting a game after a remake is announced? #$%
@#$ $#@ If they add P1 personas as demons I'd buy it #$%
@#$ $#@ god bless #$%
@#$ $#@ Will Atlus make a world where Persona 5 lasts forever? #$%
@#$ $#@ Expect P5 Arena, P5 the anime, P5DAN, PQ2 with P5 in it, and a revamped edition down the line as the bare minimum. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would've been better if he always looked fucking pissed #$%
@#$ $#@ The hero we don't deserve #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate this design so fucking much. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hope they don't try to keep and salvage it in the future #$%
@#$ $#@ That one in your pic #$%
@#$ $#@ top-tier, thank you #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe they did it on purpose. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt doubt it, honestly. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's more tolerable in Apocalypse #$%
@#$ $#@ asura roga mother fucker #$%
@#$ $#@ Nocturne you blazing faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ SMTV or Nocturne remake probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ That teaser doesn't strike me as Tokyo getting literally nuked or a rebuilding post-apoc society #$%
@#$ $#@ Play every single game in the series and every spin-off in order or fuck off. #$%
@#$ $#@ how has it aged? #$%
@#$ $#@ probably SMTV #$%
@#$ $#@ Like that girl you liked in school #$%
@#$ $#@ chaos seems more like "I don't care about collateral along the way" #$%
@#$ $#@ A true hero #$%
@#$ $#@ My dog would probably be pretty okay with being fused with a demon if it meant becoming fucking cerberus #$%
@#$ $#@ Wh-what does that have to do with what I said? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did lucy get more and more feminine over time? #$%
@#$ $#@ Walter is such a failure of a Chaos Hero, he couldnt even do Human-Demon Fusion right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta get that waifu crowd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still not sure if you have to get every option correct because I know I fucked up a few options and still got him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since SJ #$%
@#$ $#@ fucked up the entire multiverse because he didn't want to spend money on metros #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats obvious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn Yukiko what happened? #$%
@#$ $#@ She created a dimensional portal while trying to cook for Narukami #$%
@#$ $#@ Bugaboo must be chimp-level retarded if it needs to wear a diaper. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now that I think about it, Megami Tenseis creation is weird as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that it not only exists today, but is amazingly high quality is really a trick of fate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never ever fgt #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck me I have no idea what happened to my High Pixie after she evolved from Pixie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I buy her back from the Conpendium to still get the TDE? #$%
@#$ $#@ You have poor comprehension of reaction images. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mama always told me vidya would make me a satanist #$%
@#$ $#@ If you never sacrifice the first demon in the fusion list then you're fine #$%
@#$ $#@ It basically is, Bugaboo is a pretty shit-tier demon, it is just Jimenez who loves it and plays Demon Amie with it creeping out the other crewmembers, especially Zelenin. #$%
@#$ $#@ What games is this penis machinist in? #$%
@#$ $#@ Those are the only ones I wanna play #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people always keep Pixie? #$%
@#$ $#@ Depending on the outcome, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Strange Journey, the DS one with a 3DS Remake on the way. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's really disappointing that they're reusing the shitty Doi designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your appearance will become more demonic/angelic and you'll gain the demon's powers and ideology #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd probably choose some mid-tier demon just so I wouldn't go absolutely mad with power. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Matador or Hell Biker? #$%
@#$ $#@ They seem close enough to human to where Id probably at least keep walking on two legs after the fusion. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry Im retarded, but what does that mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ The Fusion list as in the compendium? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does sacrificing ruin that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im looking at the compendium and Pixie and High Pixie are still registered. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do sacrifices get removed from the list? #$%
@#$ $#@ Time to fuse with Belphegor then. #$%
@#$ $#@ This faggot ended my "no death run" with a surprise attack and death spam on the whole party. #$%
@#$ $#@ You will have to include hee ho in every sentence if you fuse with a jack. #$%
@#$ $#@ In that case, Id probably have to go with krishna. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being an extremely handsome god of love trying to bring salvation to everyone would be nice, hopefully enough of my personality would remain so I wouldn't end up being an omnicidal maniac #$%
@#$ $#@ In your demon list, not the compendium. #$%
@#$ $#@ As long as you never sacrificed the pixie or whatever the pixie was fused into, it should be at the top of the list. #$%
@#$ $#@ thamks famiglia #$%
@#$ $#@ You think thats a problem you stupid hee ho? #$%
@#$ $#@ Soejima is a far better successor to Kaneko, Dois designs look incredibly generic and boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id fuse with Trumpeter and toot all day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats never a problem and P5 really aided that with demon voices. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would, and with my main man Ose. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I get it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The demon list as in the group below my party. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since Pixie took up the first slot, anything she fuses into will stay in that top slot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Right now my top slot demon is Matador. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still maintain that Anat is a fucking great evolution to Johanna. #$%
@#$ $#@ It definitely isn't better, but it certainly wasn't shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think that its past the time that they make Mara flesh colored #$%
@#$ $#@ No question. #$%
@#$ $#@ The switch trailer was intended to broudcast for both japs and westernize right? #$%
@#$ $#@ So we will get SMT x Switch news in E3? #$%
@#$ $#@ If it was not for nu-odin I would say it was a nocturne Remaster since the "vosh" sound and everything going black reminded me of the conception. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me a live stone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I want to see the more bizarre demon designs get the HD treatment just to see what sort of animations will come up in-battle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing him in P5 really suprised me even if the melee attack looked funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me your HP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell no #$%
@#$ $#@ Where are these rumors from, all sounds more like fantasy than fact. #$%
@#$ $#@ GIVE IT #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the best way to play SMT1? #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been emulating it on the snes with the english patch #$%
@#$ $#@ is she new or was she in og strange journey? #$%
@#$ $#@ 1 is a good game you piece of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes new like Marie in P4G. #$%
@#$ $#@ No idea what her role will be like though #$%
@#$ $#@ New, pure waifubait #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not saying 1 is bad, it's just not a good starting point for someone new to the series #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre an item dispenser for demons in SJ and enjoy the dungeons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just remember to fuse demons and manage your buffs and de-buffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do a hee-ho need to call reinforcements on your ass? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh my god I want to fuck a demon! #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megami Tensei for the famicom is the jump in point #$%
@#$ $#@ The novels are the best jump in point though #$%
@#$ $#@ Start from the Bible first fags. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet you didnt even learn Hebrew and read the CENSORED western version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Darth Vishnu is great #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Vishnu actually have lightsabers in the Hinduism? #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes me sad that none of the latter games even come close. #$%
@#$ $#@ From memory raising INT seemed to change the conversations a lot too. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, he holds a mace, conch, flower, and something else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, Star Wars was very popular among Hindus so they were retconned in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering the crazy shit Hinduism get into, Doi probably underdesign Vishnu #$%
@#$ $#@ because theyr'e demons too #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the Kalki version of Vishnu who's fated to appear a long time from now, so futuristic flair on him is a nice touch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking sameface shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Apoc is a direct sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Play IV first, try to not play them back to back since they reuse a lot of the same assets/areas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing SMTIV gives a lot of context for where the game starts in IV:A around the middle of Neutral IV but gameplay wise you are far better off with IV:A. #$%
@#$ $#@ IV had a shitty story but it was still better than IV:A, but you can't argue the QoL and boss fight improvements #$%
@#$ $#@ Not familiar with SMT, but I came into this thread expecting at least an ecchi dump of this bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ No fucking way, I take it back. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Nintendo does? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you fucking retarded or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a reason SMT IV sold like ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Statue of Liberty looks pissed #$%
@#$ $#@ Well its on the easy side as far as SMT goes except for the super bosses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just watch out for elemental weakness and resistances, and missing attack/accuracy. #$%
@#$ $#@ These matter a lot #$%
@#$ $#@ is there one that lets me retain my consciousness and humanoid form? #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck playing video games when youre too small to hold the controller, nerd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please, Pixie isnt that small. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes only like 30cm tall, at best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldnt it technically be the other way around? #$%
@#$ $#@ Doppelganger maybe #$%
@#$ $#@ Whichever turns me into a giantess with huge titties. #$%
@#$ $#@ man that pic makes her look way too cute for a demon #$%
@#$ $#@ how progressive. #$%
@#$ $#@ TDE in Nocturne and 8th day were on point #$%
@#$ $#@ I like the idea that when you recruit or fuse a demon, that demon basically becomes infatuated with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ The battle for mankinds soul requires drastic measures, such as becoming the ultimate waifu. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's an exception, because Raidou is just a goddamn heart throb #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm starting to think he doesn't even care and just likes playing dress up #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes got great style and wants to become the best girl for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt there a theory that says he was also teddie in P4? #$%
@#$ $#@ and Ash is in a coma since the first episode of Pokémon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except that this might have some ground since smt is not a childrens plaything and is known to throw around some wierd shit #$%
@#$ $#@ So do Japanese girls really draw Raidou being gay for their own sexual reasons the same we look at girl on girl stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do girls like that sort of thing? #$%
@#$ $#@ SMTIVA really suffers from the let's reuse 80%+ of the ideas and designs of IV, so even if the gameplay is objectively better it's hard to enjoy it more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its painful but I like drawing her sometimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ the main problem with it is the gay as fuck plot and persona tier characters #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell Biker is in P5 though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, I dont play Normie games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hope they put him in SMT HD though #$%
@#$ $#@ This person seems trustworthy! #$%
@#$ $#@ SMT II 30th year remake #$%
@#$ $#@ Did they? #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to rip and tear Asherah's butt desu #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a pig riding a twinkie, get it right #$%
@#$ $#@ Hotline Miami 2 when you play as the writer guy, if you start out only knocking people out and you take bullets out of guns when you pick them up, but if you beat people up/draw blood you can use weapons yourself, screen gets a red tint. #$%
@#$ $#@ This seems like the kind of bait I'd fall for if I'd never been to /co/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is CN so shitty now? #$%
@#$ $#@ are movies on the same boat? #$%
@#$ $#@ gravity falls is the only good modern cartoon if you aren't an enormous manchild #$%
@#$ $#@ anime is a different world. #$%
@#$ $#@ used to be a better place. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, since the budget for a mongolians moving picture is scraps compared to a budget movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing cartoons do better than anime is comedy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not even close in that regard. #$%
@#$ $#@ so often you can't even talk about story with anime because it'll just be a manga or ln adaptation. #$%
@#$ $#@ does the same happen with cartoons a lot? #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fucking shit I never knew about this #$%
@#$ $#@ I think they skipped the funny, kid-friendly bullshit, and went straight into lore to quickly finish off the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the best of anime beats the best of cartoons but overall I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ he lives in a pineapple under the sea? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do retards keep calling japs gooks? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know dey arr rook same but seriously I dont mix up dune coons and curryniggers even though they look similar so what gives? #$%
@#$ $#@ But Gravity Falls ended a while ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not even a minute long #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not perfect, I agree, but compared to the rest of the shit in this thread it's pretty great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh god thats just retarded, why are cartoons these days trying to be way too deep insted of just being wacky and funny? #$%
@#$ $#@ Only Jakes physical body changed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything else is the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ asuras wrath is the pinnacle of what he means but not a great game #$%
@#$ $#@ Jake's powers come from an extradimensional shapeshifting being that raped his dad's head. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre ending the show soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's no way in hell they'll be close to explaining everything by the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ what the fuck though. #$%
@#$ $#@ good idea #$%
@#$ $#@ Anime OPs are there to advertise the music industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be like Fallout Boy or The Chainsmokers making a Regular Show intro #$%
@#$ $#@ The theorycrafting was the best part. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember before it was common knowledge that Ooo was a dystopian Earth? #$%
@#$ $#@ No, as that is strongly hinted at in the first season and the first comic book. #$%
@#$ $#@ Megas XLR #$%
@#$ $#@ Because calarts #$%
@#$ $#@ This is why I stopped watching after the first part of Weirdmageddon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even the idea of leaking interdimensional space being confined to a small town threw me out of the hype. #$%
@#$ $#@ They could have presented it the way the mist in The Mist seemed to have enveloped the entire nation, at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah Reddit and Morty is pretty cancer #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck did you just say about KAMI SAMA #$%
@#$ $#@ Manga does fights way better I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Comic fights are generally pretty bland even when world destroying shit id going down. #$%
@#$ $#@ has princess bubblegum fucked the vampire chick yet #$%
@#$ $#@ Computer animation has only helped independent works #$%
@#$ $#@ is it worth buying, it looks pretty cool #$%
@#$ $#@ Not in this day and age. #$%
@#$ $#@ You actually don't know what you're talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're talking about the pilot I didn't watch it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The candy zombies from Slumber Party Panic are from PB, that's just fantasy/sci-fi and doesn't really give any hints. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, third season opened with some pretty hard out-of-ideas moments like Pinkie Pies pretty fun and nutty, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ What if there was a million of her?! #$%
@#$ $#@ They didnt really turn them into lesbians, they just jumped on the queer baiting bandwagon for a bit with giving them an arc about considering whether they should be together. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean I'm assuming that it was subtle because I don't remember it, but I'll agree that it's a good hint. #$%
@#$ $#@ The porn is the only reason why you convince yourself that you think any of that drivel is engaging to watch. #$%
@#$ $#@ He seems happy about it #$%
@#$ $#@ The joke, for you people who dont freqeunt /co/, is that all 3 of those comics are pure garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt it going to be just a TV movie though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Asuras Wrath is the best movie I have ever played. #$%
@#$ $#@ The suffering #$%
@#$ $#@ This guy is still acting like an early 90s mall goth 30 years after that scene died. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt hell make anything good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never even heard about that episode before now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually a pleasant surprise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes American in the localized version. #$%
@#$ $#@ Google "Deep Strange Journey", you living under a rock or what? #$%
@#$ $#@ The battle theme kicked ass for this game but the dungeon traps were brutal. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, the game is inferior to SJ but its also a lot more newfag friendly so to speak. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually played 4 after Nocturne and it was much harder at least in the beginning. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nocturne I really only had issues in Ikebukuro and that was against bosses. #$%
@#$ $#@ In 4 I got wrecked on Samurai training missions cause Napea a shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ IV's difficulty drops off greatly after Medusa though #$%
@#$ $#@ Strange Journey is getting fixed and SMT IV has a great sequel, so I'd start with that #$%
@#$ $#@ alright, thanks man #$%

@#$ $#@ IS THAT NEW VEGAS I SEE? #$%
@#$ $#@ Bethesda games are not for sexual; they are for buying. #$%
@#$ $#@ They used your engine right? #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to think that it was another bethesda masterpiece #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like theyre refunded to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you my son, you are special to my company and you make going online begging people to buy our game a lot easier. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy my game, as its a classic. #$%

@#$ $#@ Yes, I did get the season pass discounted, cause $50 is bullshit, but I havent pre-ordered Skyrim 2 yet. #$%

@#$ $#@ I give you EVEN MORE amazing content to an already 10/10 game. #$%
@#$ $#@ You realize I have to feed my family right? #$%

@#$ $#@ I need the money for more copies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Woah there todd, what are you doing with that grenade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Put the grenade down todd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youve already sealed your fate. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're done, I'll do to you what I did to Fallout. #$%
@#$ $#@ And I'll make the national seed vault look like child's play #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon please...buy it...for Dogmeats sake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh god, my computer got all sorts of glitches and errors just by opening this image #$%
@#$ $#@ Im ready to die for my game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you say the same? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not afraid to blow up every last one of you fucks that don't give me the money I deserve. #$%
@#$ $#@ You constantly take from me with no thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ You know what they say, "All torrents and no sales make Todd go off the rails" #$%
@#$ $#@ dont make me summon my ultimate move #$%
@#$ $#@ The delegates donald. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could forgive every flaw this game has if the combat wasn't pure shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I bought your game and modded it to hell and back Todd. #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed my fellow anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Todd is an outstanding game developer and a better man than most people can hope to be. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you, fellow Anonymous poster of V. #$%
@#$ $#@ We should all purchase Fallout 4 and the Season Pass to support this titan of our industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course I do. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I have to do is just go do other stuff for a while and not actually talk to Todd, and hell just stand there until he starves to death. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hear, hear #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a good game senpai, especially for a one person Dev crew. #$%
@#$ $#@ A while back, there was an anon who claimed to have worked at Bethesda for a while and unironically said that this was true about Todd, but he keeps getting screwed up by the higher-ups. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be honest, I wouldnt really be surprised if it were true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Todd does seem to have a certain sincerity about him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes a genuine nerd. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the problem sir? #$%
@#$ $#@ I believe I asked for Skyrim Special Edition and Fallout 4 sir. #$%
@#$ $#@ I lost my Fallout 4 and sent for a new one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill be on my way then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im kinda late. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not gonna fly with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im bringing you in. #$%
@#$ $#@ FO4 is a big game #$%
@#$ $#@ While it's fun to joke about him from everything I've seen of Todd he legit seems like a pretty good guy who knows his way around the grunt work level of game development. #$%
@#$ $#@ The impression I always had of Todd, memes aside, is that he has a lot of ambition and hopes for his games, which is why he promises so big, but implementation makes it an impossible dream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like there technically were infinite quests in skyrim, but they were all shit randomly generated fetch quests, or how oblivion had radiant ai but it was always fucking up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lot of good ideas that are too hard for him to fully implement correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not to mention hes the reason the TES got a solid mod scene. #$%
@#$ $#@ Me made the Construction Set mostly on his own. #$%
@#$ $#@ The furry shit was slightly annoying but the game was fine outside of instant death pits in boss fights. #$%
@#$ $#@ I PIRATED FALL OUT 4 TODD #$%
@#$ $#@ problem, officer? #$%
@#$ $#@ DA:I is on steam? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought all their game past like ME2 was Origin only? #$%
@#$ $#@ ...what was that...? #$%
@#$ $#@ WHERE IS FALLOUT 4!? #$%
@#$ $#@ I PIRATED FALL OUT 4 YOU FUCK AND IT WAS SHIT #$%
@#$ $#@ What seems to be the problem, officer? #$%
@#$ $#@ it's wasn't &lt;10€ yet #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon pls it's a work of art #$%
@#$ $#@ say that again #$%
@#$ $#@ IT WAS SHIT YOU FUCK #$%
@#$ $#@ okay that was good #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't think you're safe kiddo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fallout 1&amp;2 are masterpieces #$%
@#$ $#@ I will make a great game, and nobody makes better games than me believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt play Skyrim. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enough is enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fallout 4 was enjoyable though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were using...this new engine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very powerful. #$%
@#$ $#@ We have new code. #$%
@#$ $#@ *Very* powerful. #$%
@#$ $#@ More powerful than even Gamebryo, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ The other day I was testing the game, and I was climbing the most beautiful mountain youve ever seen, I mean this mountain was so great, the textures were just the highest quality ever, despite what the fake game journalists say, and they really hate me, you know, those fake game journalists? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most dishonest people ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just can't believe that those fake gaming journalists, you know, the journalists that hate me, how they still refuse to acknowledge how big my game's overworld is. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, they don't say, you know, how great my game is, and it is really great, it's the best game ever made, and it got the highest reviews, ever, period. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I know the actual stats say it got mediocre reviews at best, but if you listen to the alternative reviews, it was actually the best game ever created. #$%
@#$ $#@ And only I could have made it. #$%
@#$ $#@ And they should really stop talking about how the AI only works about half the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look, no one knew programming good AI could be so complicated. #$%
@#$ $#@ I certainly thought it would be much easier. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I did make the best AI, and it was so great, and it was so easy, and I'm always hearing from players, 'Oh, your game is so good! #$%
@#$ $#@ Its so good that Ive actually gotten tired of games being as good as your game is! #$%
@#$ $#@ And its just, you know, Im just really great. #$%
@#$ $#@ can i go now officer #$%
@#$ $#@ And, you know, every single person in the world bought my game, as long as you ignore all the people who didnt buy it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why doesnt the gaming media talk about that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Get raped nigger #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure showed me buddy #$%
@#$ $#@ What game? #$%

@#$ $#@ Thats actually pretty good. #$%

@#$ $#@ Pretty sure DS and BB have been a thing for a long time. #$%
@#$ $#@ who the fuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ and who cares about xfail? #$%
@#$ $#@ Phil Spencer is a pretty honest guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if he cans things like Phantom Dust and Scalebound, hes at least sincere about the industry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks likes Sony ggers are mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like the token Xcuck is upset. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck are you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is about that single player interview he had a couple of days ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre the one upset because were still getting single player games on Xbox, you faggots thought that Xbox was turning into a multiplayer only console but thats not the case at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now you fuckers once again have nothing to compete with the Scorpio and will just shout muh no games again. #$%
@#$ $#@ E3s coming, I hope your anus is ready, Sony gger. #$%
@#$ $#@ who is he? #$%
@#$ $#@ i havent cared about halo since 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I said we're still getting them in the future I wasn't talking about the present, comprehend, Sony gger. #$%
@#$ $#@ I forgot Sony ggers lack the intelligence to comprehend. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's not giving up on sp games, he's given up on all games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know, it hurts #$%
@#$ $#@ E3 baby! #$%
@#$ $#@ The asshurt is real! #$%
@#$ $#@ They want that microtransaction money #$%
@#$ $#@ thank you for taking the fall for us anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ you will not be forgotten #$%
@#$ $#@ See above on Lionhead, Scalebound looked like complete shit, Sea of Thieves and Crackdown 3 are coming, E3 is where they will have their big showing on the Scorpio. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2nd made me not care about halo #$%
@#$ $#@ You should have stuck around man, Halo 3 was the shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess you're still waiting :P #$%
@#$ $#@ Talk is cheap. #$%
@#$ $#@ What single player exclusives does he have coming down the pipeline? #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably some unannounced games. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant wait to see a show about only movies and multiplats that look better on Scorpio. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's richard spencer who unlike phil, is not videogame related #$%
@#$ $#@ Three year old movies and multiplats? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thatll be what Uncle Phil has for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder how many channels the Scorpio can pick up? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that Ill be able to watch The Price is Right, but I might need a little more than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ HAHAHAHAHA I know right he should have waited like 3 years for a mid-generation power increase thats the first of its kind for consoles! #$%
@#$ $#@ But Xbox has actual games like Nintendo, even though right now Im more interested in buying a 2DS XL over a Switch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, he should have #$%
@#$ $#@ At least while I'm waiting I'll have games to play. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of these seem fucking ancient. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still stunned that they have the balls to release the Scorpio. #$%
@#$ $#@ You realize the PS4 also has pretty much everything that Xbone has, with the exception of Gears and Halo, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Better than my fucking XBOX branded cable box. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that you are just looking for yous. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant imagine that there is a person out there that is this delusional about the state of MIcrosoft. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually own an XBOXONE, and it hasnt been turned on for nearly three fucking years. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has nothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, because that guy could totally tell back in 2013 that Microsoft was going to make an upgraded version of the xboxone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ, you are a fucking moron. #$%
@#$ $#@ The real dumb shit decision would be buying a Scorpio, because it is just a fucking re-run of the Xbone. #$%
@#$ $#@ ALL of its games are also on PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you buy a Scorpio over a PC you are brain dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ So youre just a run of the mill Xcuck then. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was a weak piece of shit compared to past Xbox reveals, I played the waiting game and now Im getting something far better. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he was smart he would have did the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should have regretted the second they revealed that weak piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad they have no games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But in my pic in the OP he says the opposite of what youre saying right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's literally saying "SP games are nice and all but MP is where the money's at." #$%
@#$ $#@ Learn to read. #$%
@#$ $#@ They say theyre sitting on a worthwhile new IP to reveal alongside the Scorpio, but Id be shocked if its actually anything interesting, knowing modern MS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone would have such low expectations of it too. #$%
@#$ $#@ All it needed was shiny graphics, lots of shit happening on screen, and some new gadgets/tech. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frame rate and story could have easily taken a backseat and people would still eat it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Terrible fuck up #$%
@#$ $#@ All he saying is that with single player longevity is not as long as multiplayer. #$%
@#$ $#@ You play a single player game, once you find everything youre done, your only option is to start from scratch or buy another game. #$%
@#$ $#@ For a multiplayer game you can keep playing any never get tired if the game is good and keep playing it for a long time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes right about that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Him saying that doesn't mean oh let's stop making single player games har har har har. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's been how many years since launch and we're still waiting for a few games to drop on this thing #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo Wars on Steam #$%
@#$ $#@ even more embarrassing is this spin #$%
@#$ $#@ PCunt, Sony gger, youre all the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yep, classic Xfaggotry. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I still had the screen cap where one of the shills said it was "For Gamers, By Gamers," and some anon responded saying, "It was for all gamers, by all gamers," so it should be nicknamed FAGBAG. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can smell the Sony niggatry in this one. #$%
@#$ $#@ I laffed #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why PS4 will always be the best for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ A marginal improvement over the PS4 Pro is pretty irrelevant when it will still have literally no games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Blazblue is Guilty Gear done right, friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe you should stop living in the 00s and evolve. #$%
@#$ $#@ If he's a casual, he'll play a bit of GG, get fucking destroyed, and never touch the genre again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, Rev 2 isn't even out yet, so there's no real point in buying GG right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless you choose to play certain waifus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mai is the easier one to learn #$%
@#$ $#@ Depends on what character you play, but do be aware that they both removed SMP and added mechanics that make OD a much bigger factor.. #$%
@#$ $#@ CF is pretty cheap for an Arcsys port thats only 6 months after the console release, so I still recommend getting started with that since everyone moved to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know what any of those acronyms mean... #$%
@#$ $#@ if he goes online in any fighting game he is going to get destroyed, its up to him if he wants to put in the time to get good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go back to tumblr #$%
@#$ $#@ You have to be blind to not notice the facial structure difference. #$%
@#$ $#@ don't reply #$%
@#$ $#@ But I want more than the same 5 people to play against! #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally blind #$%
@#$ $#@ Ugh, man thats a shit logo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hire a better graphic designer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't make it you tard #$%
@#$ $#@ release schedule destroys any chance of a community to form. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you just want to learn the basics sure, but the Burst gauge is used very differently in CF because of the OD buffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ And again, certain characters got massive changes, so playing for example Taokaka in CP will feel vastly different from playing her in CF. #$%
@#$ $#@ BB tutorials are fantastic so definitely give it a shot #$%
@#$ $#@ Hype surge would last a couple months then it would do back down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even the versus games arent including Darkstalkers anymore, beyond the obligatory Morrigan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Darkstalkers are dead. #$%
@#$ $#@ All bowls belong to Tao how else will she feast? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you arent an autistic FGC-fag that needs his inputs to be perfect down to the last picosecond, you can buy a stick that works just fine for $50. #$%
@#$ $#@ balancing is okay some characters are s tier, and the weakest characters are still viable, CF has shorter combos than previous versions, and best girl is whoever you want it to be #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck is wrong with asking that #$%
@#$ $#@ Traditional pads are clunky as fuck for 6 button fighters desu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless you grew up playing 6 button fighters on a pad, a stick or gaming keyboard is much better to learn on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or maybe one of those pads with a 6 button layout. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both are honestly fine though I find stick much more comfy to play on but thats also partly that my hands are super fucked up. #$%
@#$ $#@ $50 sticks are trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would rather play on a pad that a cheapass stick, you will think that youre learning but in actual fact the poor quality of the stick will make you even worse of a player. #$%
@#$ $#@ Try out a good quality one, or go to an actual arcade cabinet and compare how much better it is to your discount fightstick #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno dude, I dont have Donald Trump sized baby hands so pushing the buttons I need to push without accidentally running my fingers over others is hard when the buttons are so close together on a pad. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just cant look at Rachel without thinking of all the horrible things you could do to make her suffer. #$%
@#$ $#@ boy fighting games sure sound like a lot of fun #$%
@#$ $#@ How much did you pay for your stick and how much are you regretting it right now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Es and Nine are both really fucking fun #$%
@#$ $#@ He can play at almost any range provided that you handle his resources properly, and at low-level play hes actually pretty solid. #$%
@#$ $#@ He isnt very strong in this iteration, but he has gimmicks like his FRKZ which allows him to steal rounds and stuff pretty easily against weak players. #$%
@#$ $#@ BlazBlue is alright, OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally, I always preferred Guilty Gear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow BB always seemed too weeby to me, and the game looked like it had some really frustrating Touch of Death. #$%
@#$ $#@ In CT and CS it had some shit, but in CF the only ToD I can think of his Hakumen with full meter and full Burst. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it works, it works. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played BB up through CP on Xbox and used the analog. #$%
@#$ $#@ Although I couldn't imagine using the PS3 controller's analog mainly because of placement #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah not having an arcade release console CF was 11 months after arcade release in jp is why. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not much for the community to do if everything has been solved by the jps by the time you get your hands on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ BB &gt; GG in nearly every aspect #$%
@#$ $#@ There were a fuckton of graphical issues at launch, but some of it is sorted out now. #$%
@#$ $#@ It still has some issues on AMD and stuff though depending on the resolution and stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah my friend BB is some good stuff one of the best 2D fighting games out there give it a shout #$%
@#$ $#@ I play with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ both games are good you dumbass solfag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I know, but just trying to practice it in training was difficult. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think my hand just hates doing the motion. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had that problem in borderless but switched to fullscreen and worked fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe that will work for you? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant even get to the menu, its on startup. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll try looking at the forums for an answer #$%
@#$ $#@ No, but there is a really good test for finding your main that takes it into account. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can give programs startup parameters which include something to make it fullscreen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not sure what the parameter name is though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mr Google should know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just do what I do and pick a character you like. #$%
@#$ $#@ seems like turning off g-sync did the trick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Back to learning BnBs with hibiki #$%
@#$ $#@ should be obvious but yeah I meant dustloop wiki #$%
@#$ $#@ the latest one, always get the newest one possible #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody plays anything but the latest. #$%
@#$ $#@ That means Revelator for GG, and Centralfiction for BB. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still the best Slam mashup desu #$%
@#$ $#@ You could just join the /blaz/ discord or lurk the thread for when the daily rooms are held since it has pretty much players of every skill level and ethnicity #$%
@#$ $#@ any story* #$%
@#$ $#@ It is pretty good, but I have to disagree. #$%
@#$ $#@ All jokes aside, is the genuinely best slam mashup there is. #$%
@#$ $#@ he's much better now and has an actual overhead #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah hes solid now, around mid-tier at worst. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can play neutral on the level of most characters, has an OD that actually benefits him alot, and his damage is overall really high. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also he got an overhead finally. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think people have ways to use hacked vitas as pc controllers #$%
@#$ $#@ no jubei no buy #$%
@#$ $#@ Pleasing men. #$%
@#$ $#@ close in and do some mixups #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes pure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres really good drivers for DS3 at this point, just use that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cool, thanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean you should start us off, OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok here #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to fuck that squirrel. #$%
@#$ $#@ No such thing as a non-lewd Nu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where's Mai #$%
@#$ $#@ this thread is for all games, I just doubt THAT any character can compete #$%
@#$ $#@ Busy eating shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Built in distraction device. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna kiss that rat #$%
@#$ $#@ dont talk like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ its bad enough that her kind is discriminated against in the blazblue world #$%
@#$ $#@ bullet is much uglier and not as cute #$%
@#$ $#@ She is a cutie #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chimpmunk isnt cute at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ its ok if youre gay, but u dont have to let us all know #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not gay, you just have shit taste in girls and design. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok fag #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the cast of Chrono Cross #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre not good. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is a 20 year old japanese woman #$%
@#$ $#@ That is an anime character designed by a sex starved otaku, not a real girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ He isn't wrong though #$%
@#$ $#@ Camilla is unironcally better armored than her. #$%
@#$ $#@ spare me totem #$%
@#$ $#@ This is literally the blandest guy in a gas mask i have ever seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't count how many times I fapped to the flash of her getting sodomized by horse cock #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, what a bad loser is that totem. #$%
@#$ $#@ plus epais #$%
@#$ $#@ he was good up till DC #$%
@#$ $#@ I know Asian girls who are 22 and look about that young. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, we all "know" them anon #$%
@#$ $#@ so is there eyejob porn #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't stick my dick in a robot #$%
@#$ $#@ Lammy was my first video game crush. #$%
@#$ $#@ only her arms and teeth are robotic #$%
@#$ $#@ but she has no eyes, that means those holes lead to gears and wires and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do anything besides League of autist and you're good #$%
@#$ $#@ MK IV is the better design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who are you referring to? #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad their weapons cant decide what firing mode they have. #$%
@#$ $#@ They keep changing from single shot to charged shot to fucking hyper beam. #$%
@#$ $#@ name one 1 character with a shit eating grin more infuriating than this nignogs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spears with flags on them #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you actually this underage or just looking for cheap Yous? #$%
@#$ $#@ Heh I almost forgot May and Makoto shared the same colors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both their outfits are orange, black, and white, and they both have brown hair and eyes. #$%
@#$ $#@ whats wrong with her eyes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Non-weeb here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think that an utter lack of design theory constitutes Good Design. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just means "Realistic design". #$%
@#$ $#@ You can definitely make a good design seem believable, but you need to actually make a design first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because you googled What do SWAT members wear doesnt mean you designed a SWAT uniform. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just recreated one that already existed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jack off too LoL instead, the game is only good for the girls and the girls are only good for porn #$%
@#$ $#@ One day my efforts to create a replica Es will bear fruit. #$%
@#$ $#@ how about huge squirrel titties #$%
@#$ $#@ they are perky and tight #$%
@#$ $#@ How about fat squirrel ? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna like these doujins, but this nigga draws his girls to fucking soft and squishy. #$%
@#$ $#@ It works with characters who would fit those attributes but when its about characters who are shown to be somewhat toned or muscular, the shit falls apart. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im still disappointed about his Bullet doujin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Master chief is the most easily recognizable video game character of the 21th century. #$%
@#$ $#@ While not the sole responsible, Halo is the major contributor to the popularization of the FPS genre on consoles. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's deeply tied to Microsoft's own image, to Xbox Live, to the popularization of console online functionality, and even pop culture. #$%
@#$ $#@ So disappointed that the armor skill suck and glad that you can change looks in XX #$%
@#$ $#@ They really fucked up the Elite design in the most recent one #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, its a shame a lot of cool sets get garbage skills. #$%
@#$ $#@ i feel like the arms in ce were always just a tad too short #$%
@#$ $#@ The normal Zero has the diaper too ya know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also whatever those green boobs are. #$%
@#$ $#@ delete this #$%
@#$ $#@ her english va is insufferable... #$%
@#$ $#@ I think they might look normal if you took off the armor on the arms. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its kinda a length to width thing, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's gone now so don't worry about that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dub was removed in CF. #$%
@#$ $#@ looking at a still image makes Big Band look like a big autistic mess, but man is he a beauty to behold in motion #$%
@#$ $#@ The erect "dick-strap" always gets me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not even photoshop. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh cool #$%
@#$ $#@ how do I into 2D #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't remember any voices being that bad in BB #$%
@#$ $#@ Nu is a miracle and I want one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Preferably one that wouldn't want to kill me, but that's optional. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mark V is fucking sex. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you arent doing any illegal Frankenstein type shit, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair most of DJs outfits are top-tier anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, and even if I was it would be entirely justified. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, that settles that. #$%
@#$ $#@ You heard the man! #$%
@#$ $#@ But Chun-Li isnt cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it should be illegal for squirrels to molest little boys. #$%
@#$ $#@ is this official? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now its an 11 out of 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ XD xP haha #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, Kapkan is the true 10/10 design of Siege. #$%
@#$ $#@ He looks like a Russian ninja. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you feel about Twili Midna? #$%
@#$ $#@ 10/10 too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish she had a bit more screentime actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ patrician taste, anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Its kinda funny to me how TP Zelda and Midna are my favourites from the entire series while every other character in that game have awful character design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a problem? #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm not even a fan of Link's design in that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Given context, all the characters in the game have great designs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, even the clown niggers. #$%
@#$ $#@ They all fit whatever locale they were in and every character added to the moody, melancholic atmosphere of the game which I adored. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only questionable design element is the Zoras, who looked like aquatic rabbits in TP. #$%
@#$ $#@ They definitely fit the world, I agree with you on that front. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont like their designs, understand? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not a good design either. #$%
@#$ $#@ If i wanted a good realistic design ill watch the guy on the cover of Fallout New Vegas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not posting the superior nu-bubsy #$%
@#$ $#@ Morgana is so fucking cute, dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to marry Nu and become one so that I might lay waste to all! #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope so. #$%
@#$ $#@ I WANT TO MARRY THE SUSANO'O UNIT SO THAT I MIGHT TEAR DOWN THE CURTAIN OF THIS FALSE WORLD PROPAGATED BY A SELFISH FALSE "GOD" #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to hold hands with Noel #$%
@#$ $#@ Lammy is a disgusting stoner! #$%
@#$ $#@ Just about to post this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I unironically love BlackRose's design, and think its easily one of the best designs in vidya #$%
@#$ $#@ Since when Squirrel Girl used tonfas? #$%
@#$ $#@ Venom Snake was seriously the dumbest thing ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ It felt like he was only a different person because they wanted to keep up the trend of having different snakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even the best in that game #$%
@#$ $#@ You some kinda nu-male? #$%
@#$ $#@ utter shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Best browngirl. #$%
@#$ $#@ top kek #$%
@#$ $#@ Will I? #$%

@#$ $#@ Stop posting anytime, retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Come on brah #$%
@#$ $#@ left is my waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ Black Flag was shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just your average tired Ass Creed game with some pointlessly basic pirating mechanics slapped on top of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ its ruined by every single actress sounding like a dying puppy when they are getting fucked. #$%
@#$ $#@ i cant do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's just awful #$%
@#$ $#@ why does she have a banana in her panties #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, its the only actually good AC game, and the best pirate game to come out in eons. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't like AC2 even, but Black Flag was really fun #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you want to play as a socially awkward neckbeard where you sit for 14 hours a day bragging about it? #$%
@#$ $#@ that does not answer my question #$%
@#$ $#@ BF has some of the worst missions in the series, and while it is one of the few pirates games to come out in eons, it's still a pretty shit pirate game since it's about as involved as your average smartphone game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want it to be good but don't fool yourself, right now it's fucking barebones and may be fucking shit for all we know. #$%
@#$ $#@ bless your kind souls #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally gone home of the 90s games #$%
@#$ $#@ It was better than 2 though, what the fuck are you on about? #$%
@#$ $#@ Arent there? #$%
@#$ $#@ There has to be at least one, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ You do know Sea Dogs got unofficial sequels by the same dev, right? #$%
@#$ $#@ mah nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ This game was shit bu seemed alright due to the absolute draught of naval games at that time #$%
@#$ $#@ I sometimes wish autism had a cure so stupid shit like your post wouldnt exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know if this is trolling or not but you triggered me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go fuck yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks cool, any good for a comfy experience? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats ok, uncomfy is cool too. #$%
@#$ $#@ When I saw it was gone home inspired I got a little disappointed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more like the movie The Descent but you build the environment with your light gun. #$%
@#$ $#@ The guard footsteps take me from 0 to 100 real quick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not your board, kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ This makes no sense considering you can go top as literally any champion and make it work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Top is the garbage bin of LoL positions. #$%
@#$ $#@ come over here and make me faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, because they removed the random button in the new client for some reason, so you cant do that anymore unless you are God. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good taste #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean Dota 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time I checked, Tencent doesnt own Valve, so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Udyr and Trundle, but have a Poppy because shes cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ why is Top the position with the most hard counters #$%
@#$ $#@ Logically it makes sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ So many champions can go top that its a nightmare to account for balancing all of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not to say that Riot shouldn't do better than they do, but I see why they have trouble. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should play Heroes of the Storm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its good stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tristana/Singed, but I havent played in a few years since the only internet I can get where I live now has ping that rapidly fluctuates in the 170-350 range. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes a fucking corpse dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also due for a rework in the next couple of years. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one with a shred of creativity plays League of Chink Money Extraction Tactics #$%
@#$ $#@ Velkoz mid, Brand support. #$%
@#$ $#@ I sometimes play Karma and instantly regret it because adc players are all retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, I just looked it up. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have the time or patience to get into any mobas right now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I used to play league a ton. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im talking like 10 matches a day. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thousands of hours put into that game over the years. #$%
@#$ $#@ It sorta ruined gaming for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I sorta regret all that wasted time. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was definitely a fun time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only good games get good comics. #$%
@#$ $#@ League stopped being good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Understandable, but I should say thats what makes HotS so good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Matches are like 15 minutes maximum, they took one of the most annoying aspects of mobas the insane amount of time you have to put in and got rid of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish that game didnt have so much lag from playing a game with Chinese servers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would so play as Kanade. #$%
@#$ $#@ No fuck you, new Katarina is awesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even in an era where shit games can sell like gangbusters, the best way to leave a lasting legacy is to actually make something good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially if you want to make fanbases passionate enough to do shit like draw comics. #$%
@#$ $#@ If theres an autistic champion in League, Lux would probably be it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm pretty sure they're shills. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of the posts in LoL threads sound really suspicious. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I know that NOW but the idea of a normally demure qt with a hidden wild side was so appealing I had a hard time giving up on it #$%
@#$ $#@ Like which ones? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats okay anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain why they delete senran kagura threads all the time then, shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ I also just like posting Soraka, didn't realize I had this much saved #$%
@#$ $#@ filename is the proof where they came from. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do we still have absolute retards on /v/ that dont know where the art comes from? #$%
@#$ $#@ why do you fucks like posting Soraka so much most almost as bad as Ahri #$%
@#$ $#@ She is sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ You underestimate just how many furries there are on /v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ That artists been featured on the official LoL website multiple times so I dont think hes bothered too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm also weak for lesbians so that doesn't help either #$%
@#$ $#@ *enemy anymore mb #$%
@#$ $#@ Zed and Azir are the only two champions I cant really get into. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just like Nah, Im not doing this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too much work. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's funny because I actually feel that way about Azir too, he's also just not my kind of champ. #$%
@#$ $#@ I play mid purely to fuck cunts not any of this wall utility nonsense #$%
@#$ $#@ YASSSS QUEEN #$%
@#$ $#@ Katarina was the one for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looked so fucking fit in her old splash art and now they just made her look like a psycho bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate wrestling meme mans jaw. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck yes Akali is wonderful #$%
@#$ $#@ Imagine being Zac. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could stick yourself in anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's the dream #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is this character? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm guessing Dead or Alive but I'm not good at recognizing most of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except for Hitomi, Hitomi is the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're right, though Momiji was in Ninja Gaiden first #$%
@#$ $#@ You my friend have good taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ In ranked so far I've played almost nothing but Gragas in all 4 roles and I'm forced onto adc i player Draven or Lucian. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats less about the mechanics of the champion and more about the general game sense though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Simple characters can be played bad, I.E old Katarina. #$%
@#$ $#@ But being good isnt about mastering some secret trick or landing hard skill shots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its about knowing when to go in and who to jump, when to click R and what cds are up for your enemy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like every other simple champion. #$%
@#$ $#@ you now remember that Lux was basically a society diva that was conscripted and brainwashed into an operative because she was in charge of the disco ball lighting #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot dis #$%
@#$ $#@ he keep all the soldier who gets into his territory as living sex toys #$%
@#$ $#@ Its true that playing against Kled feels like being raped. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes my spirit animal, I cant play anyone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bard has to be one of the most relaxing experiences in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ No voices, just this ambient hum as you skip around picking up chimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because anything goofy and fun is considered cringe and reddit now. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's still brain dead as fuck so if you cant climb with her then you belong in bronze lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats a nice look. #$%
@#$ $#@ I look forward to the day when people realize that calling something "cringe" is as embarrassing as saying "epic fail" and collectively stop. #$%
@#$ $#@ That aint PROJECT. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you really need 1 million threads for this #$%
@#$ $#@ My dick twitches whenever I see her. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's Fucking stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the "special services" the other night bb #$%
@#$ $#@ post your sisters insta pls #$%
@#$ $#@ because wal mart is where normalfags buy their video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post your sisters arsehole. #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy games from gamestop like us cool kids. #$%
@#$ $#@ But she is a pedophile who fucks her students #$%
@#$ $#@ It's literally okay when women do it #$%
@#$ $#@ Ephebophile pls #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre getting cucked by a chink teen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Id go to war to protect that smile. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't worry we're very well acquainted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your Fucking stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I get your sisters contact information? #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't realize until just now that this artist gave Joker a dog's tail for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish she was at least your fuckin age... #$%
@#$ $#@ She's 20, and you guys like Christmas cakes #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, but Kawakami is pure. #$%
@#$ $#@ She doesnt have any dating experience, she was too busy going to school to become a teacher. #$%
@#$ $#@ Insult Katherine's voice actor one more time I double dog dare you #$%
@#$ $#@ She's a sex worker #$%
@#$ $#@ Barely doesnt mean anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Either you are a cake, or youre not a cake. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is a cake. #$%
@#$ $#@ If a woman is a virgin at 26, it means shes been imprisoned by an evil witch in a tall tower. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dudes will fuck anything no matter the defects. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok but, is she a virgin ? #$%
@#$ $#@ At most she gave happy ending massages #$%
@#$ $#@ gomenasai gaijin-san #$%
@#$ $#@ She probably wouldnt be a very good worker if she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ When people started using it interchangeably with beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hiroshimoot should really implement another filter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi Sadayo, your husbando has a tiny penis.i have a massive internet penis, see? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well not really but keep getting cucked by your slut maid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just because you see it as hitting on in your pathetic, gay brain doesn't mean it's actually hitting on #$%
@#$ $#@ good taste my friend #$%
@#$ $#@ I just liked that Joker felt more involved in her confidant over the other characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds like a whore to me #$%
@#$ $#@ Joker was pretty much equally "involved" with all confidants, what are you talking about #$%
@#$ $#@ considering she is called a sex worker by the person whom she is paying, i don't believe you #$%
@#$ $#@ because nobody is buying madden and it's been out for like almost a year now #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean he hears that shes fainted and goes to the hospital. #$%
@#$ $#@ So its one of the few s. #$%
@#$ $#@ links in the games that has the MC going off of their own accord to see someone, rather than that someone calling them over. #$%
@#$ $#@ 3 and 4 both only had like one or two out of the both of them that had an event like that happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering those parents she was paying also had corrupted hearts, were outright liars preparing to make up anything to smear Kawakami and force her to lose her job, you would have to be a total idiot not to be able to figure out that their accusation was false but and that it didnt matter what Kawakami said in her defense in that situation. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're going off on your own accord to see every single confidant when you choose to meet with them #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you write anything aside from "I'm a huge cuck", it's getting unconfortable. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd stick it in her honeymoon #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how it seems like she wants to wait for the first time until you graduate and move in together, but then couldn't handle it and gets all up in your business on Valentine's Day. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know if he's implying that Kawakami is younger than she looks or if Joker is older than he looks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre going away soon. #$%
@#$ $#@ You wont be her student. #$%
@#$ $#@ It all works perfectly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a big of flattery and small talk to try and get people to buy more food, especially from couples. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes fucking ugly my man. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know I just need my confirmation bias that Kawakami is indeed best girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ This was a pleasant surprise to me since I had picked her for fetish reasons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your wife sells her body at night. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chouno is a basic bitch, shes duplicitous to boot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Attitude &gt; appearance when it comes to cuteness. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes hideous actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait is that a man? #$%
@#$ $#@ She's a fucking spic whore who bullies my perfect frizzy-haired gumdrop #$%
@#$ $#@ she succ me off on some saturday nites my man #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I find it weird that theres almost no reason to visit romances after rank 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kawakami visiting every night was somewhat of a fix to that, I liked it even if there wasn't that much interaction there #$%
@#$ $#@ She honestly looks like a man in that pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like a drag queen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pleasure King from Yakuza 0 #$%
@#$ $#@ "Tae" in Filipino means "shit" and I feel like that word describes your taste in waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ ur mum look like man #$%
@#$ $#@ Chouno maybe is a little bitchy but I bet shes ok when you talk to her a little, besides she has a nice body. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally looks like a transvestite. #$%
@#$ $#@ I rather play a game not knowing if the voice acting is good but sounds okay to me than listen to "HUUOOOOWOOOO that was WILD DUUUUDE" bullshit from troy baker and cast #$%
@#$ $#@ does it really fucking matter #$%
@#$ $#@ As opposed to people who cant pronounce clearly Japanese things without sounding completely awkward and saying simple names like Jyun-pei-khun as June-pay-coon or -chan as chawn/chon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lets not forget grandma Chie before her Golden redub. #$%
@#$ $#@ dub first, sub on new-game plus #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont wanna hear SCREECHING japanese SCREECHING they are all SCREECHING even the males. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you understand??? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just a claim like that can be pretty damaging, especially given that whether she does it or not, the service she works for probably allows it and would carry a stigma all on its own. #$%
@#$ $#@ um excuse me secondary but it's actually called kimi no na wa #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm real fucking glad I got to her rank 10 before the trip #$%
@#$ $#@ im into that #$%
@#$ $#@ Filipinos are shit #$%
@#$ $#@ The best P5 girls are all the mature ones, Tae, Chihaya and Kawakami. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad you cant date Sae. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah there is a law against 16, I legally cant even touch her in any way, aspect or form. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im too old for teenagers at this point, and at this point, all the girls near me are already single mothers or fat. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thread talked about how if a girl is a virgin by a certain age, something is wrong with her physically/mentally or she is intentionally doing so? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sadly, it is like that for guys too. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you looked at me, there is something wrong with me physically, mentally, and most importantly, financially. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also I like video games as a hobby and thats a big turn off for girls who don't play video games, but when you have the cash, you'll get the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is what my dad taught me. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is how my mom met my dad. #$%
@#$ $#@ My mom was a Chinese whore who married an socially awkward engineering American. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someday there will be Thirds that can just be programmed as ideal compliments and this whole pesky "Dating" thing will be a horror story of the past. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hiruta&gt;all the other teachers #$%
@#$ $#@ she outright told me before she married him because she thought he would have a good, financially stable future as an engineer. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like she guessed right. #$%
@#$ $#@ My dad is ugly as hell, and I inherited some of that too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus, American girls around here in the south just dont like Asian guys unless the girl is also Asian, which there are none in my area in my age range. #$%
@#$ $#@ My mom and her older Asian female friends always told me that if you want a girl, you gotta provide. #$%
@#$ $#@ My fatass dad can despite his Autism yes he actually has it, so do I, but hey he had an engineering degree and went to China and married the first girl that was interested in him in his entire life just because she found out somehow he was an engineer in America. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes my wife. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stay away from her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant even get laid using the Internet or a handjob from any massage place lol. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont have the cash for it because I always just have enough cash to barely survive each month. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyway I can't get laid, and yes I have met prostitutes but they didn't want to have sex with me despite me paying them. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least the ones that were not fat and covered with tattoos and smoked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some girls called me a school shooter when I tried to take them on a date in my youth. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill show them what a school shooter is, but the sad thing is I cant do that because Im no longer in school. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sae is undesirable. #$%
@#$ $#@ 20 is Cake age in japan #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes for making into an aunt and sometimes babysitting your child. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't say she's half a cake #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt want an emotionally abusive bitch watching my child. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder if old feminist dykes babysitting the children of their kin and friends are suicidal haha #$%
@#$ $#@ shut up henry #$%
@#$ $#@ More like good shit because she's best girl #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone post the pastas #$%
@#$ $#@ Usami is literally grown up /jp/-tan #$%
@#$ $#@ What's wrong anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon plox #$%
@#$ $#@ Well I beat the final boss at 81, so that take for what you will. #$%
@#$ $#@ it think its easiest boss in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chihaya is a cake? #$%
@#$ $#@ the roulette fucked me the first time,but otherwise it was easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got her on my second attempt. #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean demonfu? #$%
@#$ $#@ I legitimately wouldnt past her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like seriously, I could picture her delving into the metaverse even after its vanished to kill everyones shadows. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is older than you, but shorter than you and acts younger than you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most likely no older than 21. #$%
@#$ $#@ She literally asks you if you like older women #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh well I dont think iv gotten that far with her yet #$%
@#$ $#@ Sojiro more like sojibro #$%
@#$ $#@ We get it anon, you want to fuck her thighs #$%
@#$ $#@ Dirty non-virgins #$%
@#$ $#@ Haru get off /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you sure about that? #$%
@#$ $#@ This but she's getting fucked by her autistic sisters huge cock #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Haru! #$%
@#$ $#@ They only explode if you dont kill them quickly enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ And since youve already fought them, you know what weaknesses they have. #$%
@#$ $#@ And each one has duel weaknesses, so at least you and 2 others can exploit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only died once because I got fucked by the Big Bang Burger move and didnt guard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone survive except MC, who got critted. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well Im gonna have to ask you to back off as she is my wife. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im going to marry your wife. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I know what Im getting next. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon #$%
@#$ $#@ I said no #$%
@#$ $#@ More like Havarti, like the cheese thats really good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I lack a good picture, but Cybele. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats what Im saying though. #$%
@#$ $#@ His fight was incredibly underwhelming, to the point of tedium. #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt hard, it wasnt challenging. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was literally fight multiple waves of enemies: the boss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, even the yellow groupies before the treasure room were harder as a whole then the boss himself. #$%
@#$ $#@ I swear it never played it when I had it on before. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did they update it or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's probably hard to comprehend for you since you've never had an ex to begin with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only fucks you for the post-game Valentines Day event. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the girls you romanced show up with chocolates and unless theres only one they all get mad and leave you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Valentines day and girls showing up in the middle of your dates. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have this theme for free. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want Makoto one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sojibro just understands the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ HOO BOY #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure the only reason Sojiro isnt Futabas actual father is because Futabas mother is one of the few women who saw through his bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ why didnt you just buy it digitally or order it on Amazon? #$%
@#$ $#@ since you waited weeks after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn they so fluffy. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're not making sense anon #$%
@#$ $#@ can you rephrase that, i dont understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ dumb nicofag #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you give an example of the 2nd kind of game? #$%
@#$ $#@ And give 5 five examples of the first #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to kiss Nicos cheeks and then feed her my coq. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad it just wont fucking happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats not going to fucking stop me. #$%
@#$ $#@ we kum! #$%
@#$ $#@ and we dont care mucho! #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything, videogame feets have been getting better and better with higher polycount, along with other fetishes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Say what you want about new Tomb Raider's gameplay and how shallow it is, I'm not a fan of Uncharted either, but Lora the Banditkiller does things to my dick that the oversexualized titmonster from the platformers ever could. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't know that feel because it isn't happening. #$%
@#$ $#@ bloodborne II #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek I'm a PSfag myself, man, I'm just not getting my hopes up because I don't think it's happening. #$%
@#$ $#@ From Soft should stay from sequels and just make a new title. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bloodborne 2 would just end up being like Dark Souls 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ The series peaked at Bloodborne 8 : Scholar of the first Mensis anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant even say if I like it more than the Dark Souls series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, the pure combat is better but Dark Souls has way more quality of life stuff #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly shitposting since its an exclusive and people without a PS4 literally cant prove it wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not only that, there was that ONE GAME meme for the PS4 so people felt like they had to defend Bloodborne as the system seller that's worth it #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats my only gripe as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Accessing Djuras wet dream via the Kidney Stone was pretty obtuse but so satisfying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a serious contender for my all-time favorite game so I dunno man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not going to go full autist on you though. #$%
@#$ $#@ To each his own. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you tell me why? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd genuinely like to know #$%
@#$ $#@ If you love the souls games its probably the best one. #$%
@#$ $#@ So all the 11/10's come from people who really really love the souls series #$%
@#$ $#@ more like blore lol #$%
@#$ $#@ SCEJ helped #$%
@#$ $#@ I want a "bloodborne 2" but as a new IP, miyazaki has proven that hes not very good with forced sequels #$%
@#$ $#@ We've been through this pasta already, Anon #$%
@#$ $#@ The time of souls games are over. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're finally getting another AC, or Chromehounds if we're in the best timeline #$%
@#$ $#@ gr9 b9 m9 #$%
@#$ $#@ PvP is garbage #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you speak Finnish at me! #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if that sounds neat i want a reason to buy a ps4, i don't want to buy it for persona 5 and nothing else #$%
@#$ $#@ Will monster hunter 5 have reasonable controls and lock on? #$%
@#$ $#@ E3 threads keep getting worse every year. #$%
@#$ $#@ read some gothic literature and lovecraft you fucking shit sucker, bloodborne is a work of art #$%
@#$ $#@ This, its been surpassed by Nioh, and I doubt they could come close to it if they kept trying. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are better off making another armored core since its genre is untouched. #$%
@#$ $#@ It clicks with people who are into horror, and it REALLY clicks with anyone whos into lovecraft/cosmic horror. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats where your 10s and 11s come from. #$%
@#$ $#@ dumb frogposter #$%
@#$ $#@ The combat is pretty stellar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Miles ahead of Souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sci-fi souls is objectively the best option #$%
@#$ $#@ It is the same thing except the weapons have 3 movesets instead 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ And there were only 5 weapons. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just a shitty and casual Bloodborne #$%
@#$ $#@ This made me kek and I really dont know why. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus I spend too much time on here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking hell you guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really hope you're baiting #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks Like Feces Tastes Like Shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ As if the first one wasn't shit enough #$%
@#$ $#@ Am i the only one who doesnt want a Bloodborne 2, if only for the problem that it could end up being inferior in every way and just overall disappointing. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you're bad yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ how is the lore top tier #$%
@#$ $#@ It picks up after a few missions, then slows right back down again. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you just burn through the story missions you'll probably stay interested but a lot of the extra content can be a big turn-off if you're not absolutely in love with the gameplay. #$%
@#$ $#@ This kinda explains Dark Souls 3, its a game sandwitched between A team and B team. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is fucking embarassing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even mad so long as they dont insist on using skylander-tier redesigns for every game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spyro is not as big of a meme as Crash, wont happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let alone after Crash sales come in and they realize theyve been duped. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah Im with you. #$%
@#$ $#@ From needs to cut this shit out and try something new. #$%
@#$ $#@ We're at the point where people are going to start seeing these games as being milked to fuck just as they are, and the only thing we could gain from new games are incremental improvements to the predecessors, just as we've gotten in the past. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope we get more of that TLOU + L4D lookin ass motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ As tired as zombie shit is, that looked like it might have the potential to possibly be subjectively fun to some people like me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good Satire. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sucker Punchs new IP is all but confirmed to being shown this year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Ill see what FUCKING GAMESTOP will give me for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use the credit towards something else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe that Horizon Zero Dawn that everyone is going on about. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm hyped if this is true #$%
@#$ $#@ Yoshida was openly talking about playing it back in mid-2015, so I'd be amazed if they're attempting to hold off even revealing it longer than 2 years when it was first officially mentioned. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol fucking outed this piece of shit pc fag nigger faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark Souls II came out the way it did because Bamco scrapped half the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you trying to prove by posting an upscaled 240p youtube image with 500% saturation? #$%
@#$ $#@ But I dont feel anything... #$%
@#$ $#@ weak b8 leaf #$%
@#$ $#@ bloo benis orne #$%
@#$ $#@ that feel when platinum it in 10 days #$%
@#$ $#@ wrong, shitter, roll goes further than dash, the only time dash is better than roll is when your movement is slowed #$%
@#$ $#@ BB has flaws like every other game. #$%
@#$ $#@ 11/10s are obviously exaggerations #$%
@#$ $#@ I never understood why this gif exists and why it was spammed and I still don't #$%
@#$ $#@ How can we know a videogame is bad if nobody plays them? #$%
@#$ $#@ dumb dog poster #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I could but I have nothing better to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ If I don't like it then it's bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ THANK YOU TRAPS DOGGO #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm feel'n an urge to play American Truck Simulator while listening to Skeeter Davis. #$%
@#$ $#@ QB a qt #$%
@#$ $#@ Qbee is definitely a qt, though I think her attack animations would be difficult to implement into 3d. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have X-men, disney is just too jewish to give fox free publicity #$%
@#$ $#@ We all know which VS character is getting in MVC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Todd Ziller #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just mad with how horribly designed she was in 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Take a rushdown character and make her stupid slow in a hyper fighting game and make her only good for assists. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want characters on my team for assists, I want to actually fight with them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too strangely attractive for a fish man. #$%
@#$ $#@ boring character #$%
@#$ $#@ Ike can go jump off a bridge, im still mad that it nearly happened in UMVC3, Capcom has some MSH devs, surely they can convince some dlc with their nip powers #$%
@#$ $#@ Too edgy for my liking. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ma nigga, Phobos amazing animations are what got me into playing him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hed make a great replacement for Sentinel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats silly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm saying that BB Hood is the one female Darkstalkers I'd welcome in and one of the other characters I listed. #$%
@#$ $#@ He'll most probably be a skin #$%
@#$ $#@ His animations are great, especially since he has so many of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ his animations and moveset got reworked heavily in each game. #$%
@#$ $#@ hell, even his walk cycle is different in every game. #$%
@#$ $#@ DS1 walk cycle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Legs look a little janky because at this point they were still making him out of many, mahy separate parts, meaning each thigh, each shin and the pelvis are all separate sprites. #$%
@#$ $#@ Love all the light effects going on in the eyes, and all the rotating, extending and contracting going on in the forearms. #$%
@#$ $#@ NW walk cycle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Legs movement is a bit smoother now due to each frame now being a single sprite rather than a jigsaw puzzle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uses the "butler" pose from Plasma Beam, but with the front hand rotated so the palm is facing the chest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still has some light effects going on in the eyes, but not as many as the last game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot the gif. #$%
@#$ $#@ VS2 walk cycle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Very nicely animated of course, but seems too plain, IMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing going on with the eyes, arms are in their default position. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Capcom even worthy of having him in the new game? #$%
@#$ $#@ A large part of his appeal is how great his animation looks, and seeing him look bland would be really offputting. #$%
@#$ $#@ This one? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pyron would probably be a nightmare. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern 3D games can do some pretty awesome stuff with particle effects, but the problems would come when his entire body changes shape, like in Zodiac Fire, or his standing hard punch. #$%
@#$ $#@ They have to pay royalty for Takeshi Kaneshiro, the Japanese actor they used the likeness of for Samanosuke if they were to put him in. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was talking about his super where Cecil scream IKE! #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, that one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres a gif. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id rather just have Shonen Jump all star game desu. #$%
@#$ $#@ We already had two on the DS #$%
@#$ $#@ less than 10 percent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Characters like Ruby Heart, Amingo, and SonSon are not coming back unfortunately. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't hold out for Jin either, and he's my most wanted character in the roster. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can see Captain Commando coming back though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Generally I wouldn't hold my breath for nostalgic capcom reps, we already have Strider, we're going to get characters from popular series. #$%
@#$ $#@ wasted slot #$%
@#$ $#@ Uncle scrooge. #$%
@#$ $#@ A common theory is that Ruby and Amingo were rejected vampire characters, both feel quite natural for that series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, I just had the though that if Darkstalkers 4 ever came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ What better way to hype up the series than have Amingo or Ruby heart show up in the teaser. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hiryu's theme is always excellent tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Very good list. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it counts though, Kyosuke was in CvS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss fighting game music like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only way youll get a monhun rep is Palicoes. #$%
@#$ $#@ The monhun team already said they dont want hunters in fighting games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Breaks the whole self insert thing or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, X and Sigma are also the only newcomers weve seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Otherwise they've just been getting the obvious vets out of the way early #$%
@#$ $#@ ptx-40a was cool #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope so #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say thats Dante, but Gene is probably the most beloved one that isnt yet in MvC. #$%
@#$ $#@ Possibly second to Dante overall. #$%
@#$ $#@ she was in mvc3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Your waifus a bottom tier shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tiers dont really matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its mostly because they had his assets already from MvC3. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm hoping that if Jill does come back, it's RE1/MvC2 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they wanted to do something new and make an RE3 version, I wouldnt mind. #$%
@#$ $#@ g-red would be neat #$%
@#$ $#@ I have to wonder why those two specifically. #$%
@#$ $#@ Old theme has some parts that sounds kinda like Mute City #$%
@#$ $#@ The bits Ive heard from the gameplay trailers tells me that the synth is going to get even worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ultrons theme sounds like ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ yo guns? #$%
@#$ $#@ Which Gwen? #$%
@#$ $#@ Masamune Date #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont recognize the entire bottom row. #$%
@#$ $#@ No Roll no buy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The MH producer said he doesnt want a rep in the versus games because he feels that would become the default hero/look or whatever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also hes the grandson of the president of Capcom, so yeah. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eh, I'd like pretty much any MM rep that isn't roll. #$%
@#$ $#@ X, TronBonne, Sigma and Zero/Protoman/Bass.Exe would be fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck did Midnight Bliss become the move that defines Demitri? #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate this meme #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they're hints instead of "dese r da charactars we knu u rike but we can't add because of americajin company so here da colurs ohoho". #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause that would suck if it means nothing, like don't tease with colors if you aren't gonna go for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fap material, mostly #$%
@#$ $#@ Jill was literally the easy mode character in the first game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chris was the standard difficulty, and hes been in more games. #$%
@#$ $#@ My life. #$%
@#$ $#@ How was the mobile version of EW? #$%
@#$ $#@ I finally have a good phone and wouldnt mind some alien killan action for my lunch breaks. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't trying to be ironic, EU+ is the Vita version #$%
@#$ $#@ Almost unplayable without amphetamine #$%
@#$ $#@ Also typo in the subject and I cant delete the post. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ was a mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have been browsing the catalog, over and over for 14 hours straight with just bathroom breaks and faps in between. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn I should seriously just kill myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not my board. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep posting, dummie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im like 100 of them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone moved to /tv/. #$%
@#$ $#@ and yet here he is, still posting on the board he claims to be above. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being above someone is no fun if you can't rub it in their faces #$%
@#$ $#@ All the ghosts that have been stuck here since the great enemy crab battle of 2006 #$%
@#$ $#@ Now its a Reddit colony. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not stupid, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why tell the fools Im trying to avoid where I go? #$%
@#$ $#@ See ya. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry lads, but I think the music fucking sucked compared to past games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Christ, you really do have shit taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4s was easily the weakest. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol fag #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Face Myself personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though final boss music still goes to P3 #$%
@#$ $#@ I will say that P5's final boss music was pretty weak, but I still liked it over 4's. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah 3 is in a league of its own. #$%
@#$ $#@ What will be the point if they knew the guy earlier in the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ The lyrics are actually pretty sick. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's RIVERS IN THE DESERT by the way #$%
@#$ $#@ Door-Kun got one hell of a climax. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was at level 55 you turd #$%
@#$ $#@ Genesis was pretty terrible, but The Almighty wasnt bad #$%
@#$ $#@ This is some grade A bait #$%
@#$ $#@ But you literally do know that Shido is the big bad dude right from the start lmao. #$%
@#$ $#@ On top of him being a shit boss fight you always knew the game was building up to fighting him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally no grinding done at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does she even sell SP recovering items apart from rings? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wouldnt I then have to do the entire last two dungeons again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want to have to do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea like what? #$%
@#$ $#@ russian bias piece of shit game #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, the devs are Russians after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is /wtg/ such horseshit ? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's one of the worst concentration of retards i've ever seen and the discord looks like it managed to be even worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ maybe it has something to do with the player base mostly being russians #$%
@#$ $#@ G*rmboo tears are amazing #$%

@#$ $#@ So are her tits,ass, and thighs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think I can manage #$%

@#$ $#@ Nier 1 is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre about the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ silent hill homecoming, game sucked but that music is so good #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant tell you. #$%
@#$ $#@ The dankest and most illegal memes #$%
@#$ $#@ Could list many more examples of this unoriginality? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is easily the most forced meme thread of the past few years #$%
@#$ $#@ I still think that honor goes to "good idea bad idea" with geralt from witcher 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ That or the "NOOTROLL" threads with the shitty ms paint comic or renegade/paragon image. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is, its just not self-contained, which is a flaw, but to say the game isnt entirely wrapped up by the end if youve watched all of kingsglaive and the anime is laughable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Zero #$%
@#$ $#@ The Same Thread of OPs Unoriginality. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes just really anemic okay? #$%
@#$ $#@ Some people are autistic as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has been a lot more than that #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that you need to churn out supplementary viewing material in order for the story of your game to be coherent and "complete" is laughable. #$%
@#$ $#@ My bike! #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you gonna do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Listen to Maurice Chavez on VCPR #$%
@#$ $#@ go get some sleep #$%
@#$ $#@ I'll drop by your office tomorrow and we can start sorting this mess out #$%
@#$ $#@ Maurice was the shit #$%
@#$ $#@ WAIT SONNY #$%
@#$ $#@ Dat bank robbery mission #$%
@#$ $#@ Hekepthisheaddown, helps people forget #$%
@#$ $#@ as soon as i heard that line i knew he was a cunt #$%
@#$ $#@ Cuz he thought he would he be killed in vc no one actually expected him to build a empire #$%
@#$ $#@ Koei tecmo is a specialist of downporting though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Clearly not, or at least not porting to Switch, there are games that look and run better than that on Switch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like the typical difference between a pc game and a ps4 game, why are people so hung up on it? #$%
@#$ $#@ For example? #$%
@#$ $#@ DQH runs native 1080p on the switch. #$%
@#$ $#@ most of switch games cant run this resolution. #$%
@#$ $#@ MK8D proves you wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ they make all games on pc first. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can throw out all of the acronyms and buzzwords you like, something looking good isnt a technical sheet, MK8D looks good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pokemon ForestGreen and LavaRed? #$%
@#$ $#@ A gen 1 remake in 3D? #$%
@#$ $#@ If they redid the combat, this would actually be great #$%
@#$ $#@ OmegaFireRed and AlphaLeafGreen #$%
@#$ $#@ Mars Red and Neptune Blue would be nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kanto is currently the most outdated region mechanically and its one region that could really use an aesthetic overhaul to make it more geographically interesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ All pokemons are aliens,but yeah more "eerie" stuff could be cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ eric im'm going to cum inside you #$%
@#$ $#@ You sure sound mad that we're having a good time #$%
@#$ $#@ A PC version. #$%
@#$ $#@ It could be cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would work for the switch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Before SM was revealed there was leak I think on twitter where they had the game logos and both files were called niji which means rainbow, just like hoshi means stars. #$%
@#$ $#@ get in the fucking bag you little shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Something from Game Freak with "PS Vita/Wii U level graphics" is coming Fall 2018 according to job listings they put out recently, so expect Switch Pokemon November next year. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything happens this year with mainline, itll be a second Gen VII game on 3DS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whether thats another Alola game, some form of Kanto revisit between the 20th Anniversary movie and Lillie going to Kanto at the end of SM, or some form of Sinnoh revisit as possibly implied by the unusual Sinnoh shilling in said anniversary movie, who knows. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just an ad for a product line at Japanese Pokemon Center stores surrounding Cosmog, which is a little starry nebula cloud thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ People are just memeing because of the debunked "Stars" "leaks". #$%
@#$ $#@ Also I should mention they blew their event nut for Gen VII already with every event item or Pokemon introduced with SM having either already been distributed or slated for distribution this year, so unless something comes out this year with new event stuff coded in then Gen VIII is almost definitely going to start next year. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Red Blue remakes on the Switch #$%
@#$ $#@ Gold and Silver are the direct sequels to Red and Blue you fucking retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ My very obvious implication was "sequel that revisits Kanto instead of resorting to remaking R/G a second time." #$%
@#$ $#@ He probably means something like Black2/White2...so a gimped G/S. #$%
@#$ $#@ well I mean theres no better word that I can think of currently for it so Im sorry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh we ae in the "it was all shit" phase already? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is so predictable. #$%
@#$ $#@ You clais never match the archives so it's irelevant, but you'll have to wake up, kiddo, pretendig games are bad just for attention never works. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, Ive been saying it was weak since it came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ There may be dozens of other anons who liked it, and that's fine, but I sure didn't. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh and I'd actually love an action RPG combat system, but that's not going to happen until sales plummet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Timetravel gimmick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both prehistoric pokes and super evolved ones. #$%
@#$ $#@ An actual 3D remake would be pretty cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something closer to current Zelda not mechanically but, as far as the 3D space you move around in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its still too top-down. #$%
@#$ $#@ That the game runs on the 150Mhz GPU mode, rather than the 300, so it can last 5+ hours on the battery. #$%
@#$ $#@ A third Orre game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Switch most likely won't get anything until next year, and it'll probably just be a new generation, same gameplay as always, same graphical style as XY and SM battles but way more high fidelity environments and overworld. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pokemon has dozens of spinoffs for a reason, play those. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its really not though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sleeping pill... #$%
@#$ $#@ Taking effect... #$%
@#$ $#@ If waking up impossible... #$%

@#$ $#@ Oh nevermind theyre the one who drew that Shulk pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ He never drew Shulk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre thinking of Rock Howard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you are the western counterpart of Mishafag and people actively avoid your request spam. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is not Shulk. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Rock Howard from King of Fighters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess its kinda hard to tell whether you are joking or not when you ask for Doomguy stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont see his face, so its harder to think of him really appealing to someone without knowing if hes cute or not. #$%

@#$ $#@ Is it actually possible to make a steady income off of just drawing stuff like non explicit smut and pinups without having to go full lewd? #$%
@#$ $#@ Very nice. #$%
@#$ $#@ People in /d/ #$%
@#$ $#@ eh, what are you gonna do. #$%
@#$ $#@ OR here, thanks for drawing her. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had actually forgot to mention that I didn't want the hood, so I'm glad you drew it that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ And of course i forget image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shoebills are awesome. #$%

@#$ $#@ kill yourelf #$%
@#$ $#@ what game #$%
@#$ $#@ Metro 2033 #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess James leaving town to raise a bratty kid he barely knows is kind of a bad ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonic CD #$%
@#$ $#@ Unfortunately not infamous 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's not real is it #$%
@#$ $#@ La Pucelle: Tactics #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres nothing in the game that suggests that he went on to raise or adopt Laura after the Leave ending. #$%
@#$ $#@ End this fanfiction bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fatal Frame series #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally MGSV #$%
@#$ $#@ Splinter Cell Double Agent #$%
@#$ $#@ Life is Strange #$%
@#$ $#@ What game is it though?? #$%
@#$ $#@ shit forgot to remove the image #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon, that would imply that there were any sequels to Dark Souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ What game, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the way Corpse Party went about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrong endings are bad endings that never really happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ True endings are bad/good endings that are non-canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow Hearts. #$%
@#$ $#@ you know, that game where you have your kinda own mother who got transformed into a rat get raped by other rats and laugh about it #$%
@#$ $#@ Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain #$%
@#$ $#@ I will never be mad at this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that game any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now, you know thats just not true. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Binding of Isaac #$%
@#$ $#@ Binding of isaac #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, alrighty then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Binding of Isaac. #$%
@#$ $#@ That RNG piece of shit produced by a numale beta cuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dead Rising #$%
@#$ $#@ you were the savior of humanity, its just that the aliens put you in a coma before you could finish. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone knows the commander was gonna wipe the floor with the aliens and the second he got free, he did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt matter what you thought of the endings. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre both canon to some extent, considering both Otacon and Meryl are alive in the sequels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only the Meryl ending was canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing in that contradicts Otacon surviving since Campbell called off the air strike #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't played every single of those games yet, but I don't remember a single good ending for those I've played on any routes #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigga what the fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked the third game as well : #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, that is true. #$%
@#$ $#@ My b. #$%
@#$ $#@ name games that does that #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, it's a pretty good JRPG on it's own, but it's a letdown compared to the second game #$%
@#$ $#@ Heres how Taro works. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's some "good" endings in there too #$%
@#$ $#@ This actually pisses me off. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every Bethesda game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will never get over how Deus Ex Invisible War did this #$%
@#$ $#@ What game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Crysis/Crysis 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I can respect that. #$%
@#$ $#@ SHC was a masterpiece. #$%
@#$ $#@ It even gives you the illusion of a choice then plays the same cutscene #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much anything made by Bioware. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of them are better than others. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody could possibly say the sequel is the best in the series with that combat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wat gaem? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not mad. #$%
@#$ $#@ As much as I was okay with DS3, EA had sucked what life Dead Space had in it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Awakening was the perfect ending to the series, especially if you equate Brethren Moons with EA. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna give this game a go, should i play enemy unknown first? #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked Invisible War #$%
@#$ $#@ And I liked Devil May Cry 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ The second game has a cliffhanging teaser at the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, Advent doesnt appear to be completely gone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe there will be three factions? #$%
@#$ $#@ Calm down, boner. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Darkness 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ I was pissed off The Witcher 3 did that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did they finish the stein;gate sequel? #$%
@#$ $#@ It reminds me of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats some pretty heavy 4th wall breaking stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ KAIN IS DEIFIED #$%
@#$ $#@ you see the consequences at the end of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's why it's called an "ending". #$%
@#$ $#@ you would rather games always end with shitty "sequel bait" endings instead of a satisfying experience? #$%
@#$ $#@ well it could make sense, once you reached the true ending, it means the story is over and there's no need for a sequel #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope they re-release the first 2 Shenmues. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive always wanted to play them but Ive been a sonyfag all my life and dont feel like shelling out for a Dreamcast and an XB just so I can play one game. #$%
@#$ $#@ obviously mass effect 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that, if I were playing a VN and that shit happened, I'd be done with romancing waifus #$%
@#$ $#@ where is english translation for this game, its been years #$%
@#$ $#@ This really grinded my gears to boi end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mega Man X5 #$%
@#$ $#@ The Witch and the Hundred Knight does this. #$%
@#$ $#@ you feel it too, don't you #$%
@#$ $#@ I think he's confused, Bloodborne is more of a thematic sequel than a direct one #$%
@#$ $#@ they're not evil or demonic though #$%
@#$ $#@ Does any of novels even translate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really the Canon ending but blops 2s bad end was way better than the others. #$%
@#$ $#@ Golden Sun #$%
@#$ $#@ Mass Effect 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ so literally julian... #$%
@#$ $#@ young britney had a world class ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Is ding ding also a gay furry? #$%
@#$ $#@ it's the 1st of may retard #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this confirmation they are dating #$%
@#$ $#@ I was a teenager in early 00. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spears never had nothing special. #$%
@#$ $#@ There was better material to fap. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just get aroused by the fame #$%
@#$ $#@ What are some games that do this? #$%
@#$ $#@ dragon's dogma, death's finger #$%
@#$ $#@ maker's finger* #$%
@#$ $#@ Shin Megami Sentei #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats precisely why I love Etrian Odyssey. #$%
@#$ $#@ The games encourage you to use them on bosses, and in a lot of cases theyre straight up necessary. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not quite the same thing but in Persona 5, if you fight the Reaper during Flu Season, theres a chance that it starts off with the Despair Ailment which causes it to mope for two turns then Sudoku on the third. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is every Persona after 2 in a nutshell. #$%
@#$ $#@ name 50 games that do this #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty cool how Fire Emblem managed not to fuck this up. #$%
@#$ $#@ In P5 there are a bunch of strong enemies with no weakness, that's where ailments are really useful, also they work on mini-bosses #$%
@#$ $#@ Gun skills best skills #$%
@#$ $#@ And lots of those ailments will let you get critical damage from various abilities. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really instant kill mechanic but in Gothic 2 there is a spell called destroy undead which deals MASSIVE damage oneshots anything iirc and works on bosses. #$%
@#$ $#@ in skyrim there is a -100% health potion that can 1-shot dragons, i don't know if it can kill Alduin tho #$%
@#$ $#@ what game #$%
@#$ $#@ what is alduin anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta make the top-spin worthwhile somewhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gold box Pool of Radiance. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was mostly thinking of shurikens but w/e. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that a actual boos or just an FOE? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's only one enemy in the game you can't oneshot with Triangular Gate, and it's one you'll never encounter in the normal campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fire Emblem. #$%
@#$ $#@ When you fuck up, boy do you fucking fuck up. #$%
@#$ $#@ L R Start #$%
@#$ $#@ The boss isnt immune to instadeath, Climax kills anything below half HP, do the math. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Shido #$%
@#$ $#@ PK Flash from the Mother series #$%
@#$ $#@ FFIX also had a boss like this, which ironically was actually one of the hardest bosses in the game without that tactic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a game where you can have high enough speech to convince a final boss to just kill himself? #$%
@#$ $#@ Icewind Dale II Disintegration spell. #$%
@#$ $#@ in the mmo lineage 1, there were a few undead bosses you could instantly kill with the turn undead spell, although the chance to succeed was so low that most players would waste all their mana if they ever attempted to do so. #$%
@#$ $#@ This reminds me of that iguana attacking that fake iguana. #$%
@#$ $#@ Triangular Gate costs too much to be usable alone against the sort of hordes EYE throws at you. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can oneshot one or two enemies before youre low on health and out of energy. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not hard to quickly recover from that in the lategame, but it's still easier to just carry a gun to handle the masses and save the oneshots for the really big targets. #$%
@#$ $#@ While a glitch, most bosses and even the final boss could be downed with SAW. #$%
@#$ $#@ Final Fantasy 7, Cait Siths dice can 1-shot anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ What game? #$%
@#$ $#@ iirc, silver armor was available at that point, but it was really far out of the way and expensive #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mass effect 1 #$%
@#$ $#@ Final fantasy II you can kill almost anything with the Teleport and Toad spells. #$%
@#$ $#@ The devs remembered to make bosses immune to "Death" but Teleport and Toad were considered something different. #$%
@#$ $#@ those ones are the most boring #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow of mordor #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah fuck that game #$%
@#$ $#@ this is logical though #$%
@#$ $#@ you forgot thorns #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish DS3 had the damage types mechanics back. #$%
@#$ $#@ I killed all skeletons with a rapier. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have mistletoe growing in my backyard. #$%
@#$ $#@ You aint shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ except when it makes you aware of how much your skills/character have grown. #$%
@#$ $#@ It can be done right. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not quite what your looking for, but bringing Charlotte with one of her priest classes forget which one has Turn Undead, which instant kills all undead and makes at least one, possibly two of the three possible final bosses a joke, its not an instant kill but 9999 damage on a boss with only 14k-ish hp isnt anything to scoff at. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially if you bring Hawkeye as Wanderer who can shave off 1/6th of every bosss max hp at the start of the fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Combined, you may as well have oneshot Dark Lich, cant recall if it works on Archfiend. #$%
@#$ $#@ In FFV, there was a boss that you could use a level-lowering blue magic forgot what it was called to lower the bosss level to a multiple of 5, so that you could use lvl5 Death on it and instakill it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's even worse if it's the spell that reflects for all members #$%
@#$ $#@ literally never happened in any video game go fuck yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ NAME ONE GAME #$%
@#$ $#@ I love this shit way too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mother 3 Porky Statue #$%
@#$ $#@ The New Year's Bomb instantly kills it instead of bringing it to 1HP, but whatever #$%
@#$ $#@ The New Year's Bomb brings HP to 1, its right #$%
@#$ $#@ What game? #$%
@#$ $#@ Baldurs Gate? #$%
@#$ $#@ Atomos in FFV would slowly pull in your downed characters, and if you didn't revive them quickly enough they'd disappear and become impossible to revive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Omega and other lategame enemies and bosses had moves that would do it instantly. #$%
@#$ $#@ More than that, repeatedly halve level down to 1, then you can also use !Mix to add on 20 more levels, halve it again and its at 10 because it drops the remainder. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think that will kill absolutely everything thats not undead. #$%
@#$ $#@ One Piece: Treasure Cruise has made this into an entire dynamic of meta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Surprisingly deep for a mobile game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hol up, the tower of magic and tower of strength from FFV worked like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Interesting to know in hindsight.1 #$%
@#$ $#@ Witcher 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck fighting Undead in Age of Wonders. #$%
@#$ $#@ All of that good shit they get far outweighs being vulnerable to turn undead. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the diplomacy, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ also all over the first Dead Rising game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are there any Inafune failures other than MN9? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah X4 is legit good #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive heard good things about the show. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it half as good as Gumball? #$%
@#$ $#@ the sonic tumblr advertises new episodes so it has to be #$%

@#$ $#@ Use kimcartoon.me, its endorsed by the kisscartoon guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, its actually genuinely solid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eggman as usual is best character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the heads up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I was using .IO and it even continued to update with some episodes like Samurai Jack. #$%
@#$ $#@ T-there is an unclit reference?! #$%
@#$ $#@ One Punch Knuckles #$%
@#$ $#@ This was great. #$%
@#$ $#@ You might want to check on your computer man, the fake kisscartoon gives a rootkit to your machine #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I'm doing now, running various scans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh I didn't know there was a replacement #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a replacement, it's just another site. #$%

@#$ $#@ is he dare I say /ourhedgehog/ #$%
@#$ $#@ /co/ plebs don't really have a torrent culture, that's an /a/ thing. #$%

@#$ $#@ it's kisscartoon but ~different name~ because that's totally going to keep the lawyers away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just really sick these on rails 3D Sonic games. #$%
@#$ $#@ They should just hire the guys that made Sonic Utopia to make a 3D Sonic game like they did with the guys who are working on Sonic Mania. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're on rails cause the last time they tried we got travesties known as Sonic 06 and the Werehog section in Unleased #$%
@#$ $#@ whats a safe torrent site? #$%
@#$ $#@ I felt like I was the only person that hated the modern Sonic levels in Generations. #$%
@#$ $#@ He controls so poorly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I would take a smaller game thats just Sonic stages in the style of Adventure 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking love that doujin. #$%
@#$ $#@ torrenting.com seems pretty alright though they tend not to have older stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ does it have good hd quality shows, and i need an account? #$%
@#$ $#@ It has what I watch, which is pretty mainstream. #$%
@#$ $#@ Releases come pretty fast and are usually 720p. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a private tracker so you do need an account. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you looking for? #$%
@#$ $#@ sonic boom, that gumball show, mr. #$%
@#$ $#@ robot, law and order, maybe some new documentaries #$%
@#$ $#@ They dont seem to have older episodes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only recent stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that sombra? #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I have the rest? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ a twitter link #$%
@#$ $#@ The only good thing Teen Titans Go did was the episode where it insulted itself for being so blatantly inferior to the original show. #$%
@#$ $#@ da fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ more like getting her pussy wet #$%
@#$ $#@ he must have gotten a lot of people asking for him #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna wet her pussy with my cum #$%
@#$ $#@ Show and comics have overshadowed the games since Sonic Adventure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Boom is the only CG Sonic show so if you remember it having that kind of animation instead of traditional 2D, then it was it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a French co-production by the way. #$%
@#$ $#@ its a comic and the name is Sombra's Leaked Photos #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes always wet. #$%
@#$ $#@ my sides #$%
@#$ $#@ What is the sauce on this semen demon #$%
@#$ $#@ I think its even more funny that Chris himself chalked it all up to pure coincidence. #$%
@#$ $#@ like at least a 7/10? #$%
@#$ $#@ I played SC and that was a 6/10, something to dump time but not really complete, is it maze based like SC or something else? #$%
@#$ $#@ what are you talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ generations was fucking awesome! #$%
@#$ $#@ forces and mania are gonna be great too judging by what we've seen so far #$%
@#$ $#@ c'mon anon you have to go along to get along #$%
@#$ $#@ Forces is taking Generations 2 and somehow fucking it all up. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't see how it looks pretty good to me #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, in actual Sonic the Hedgehog. #$%
@#$ $#@ In Sonic Boom hes basically actually retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mania make Classic in Forces look pretty bad by comparison. #$%
@#$ $#@ doubt it everyone treats it like sonic 06 2.0, least we have the cartoon #$%
@#$ $#@ Ken Pontac is writing the show? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought he was writing the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ No hes not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its by the writers of Drawn Together. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe its the voice director. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or Boom Sonics different characterization. #$%
@#$ $#@ Voice direction. #$%
@#$ $#@ An example is Amy, who sounds more Minnie Mouse in Generations, but sounds just fine in Boom. #$%
@#$ $#@ all VA have really impressed me with how good they have come to represent and characterize the characters, I mean in season 1 the only ones I really liked were Eggman and Knuckles but now it feels they have got used to the roles and improved a lot #$%
@#$ $#@ It's almost definitely bad dub voice directors #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty much Green Hill in name only. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its completely different because Eggman is Terraforming the entire planet for whatever reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was always gullible, but he was never an actual idiot until Boom. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gonna need some sauce on that claim, Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein don't have this in their imdb #$%
@#$ $#@ Bill Freiberger #$%
@#$ $#@ ...was an EP, not a writer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want them to do it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ He writes for Boom #$%
@#$ $#@ I normally hate 4th wall jokes, but Boom has been so damn good with them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its because roger craig smith just has a really annoying sarcastic sounding voice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Outside of anime, I dont even know where to look for torrents nowadays. #$%
@#$ $#@ This image reminds me- is there a good, concise summary on how nuts Ken Penders is? #$%
@#$ $#@ I need to show a friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you fucking kidding me #$%
@#$ $#@ I have this #$%
@#$ $#@ This is actually pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just show him this. #$%
@#$ $#@ He will understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ The bot that he punched was even "virtually indestructible" as Eggman put it #$%
@#$ $#@ you take that back you filthy jew. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gumball is pretty shit and cringy tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even memeing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Season 2 was awful and it just kept getting worse #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing Teen Titans related has been good since Wolfman's run #$%
@#$ $#@ trust me it's better you don't. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its usually even worse than this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its only one episode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Metal Sonic is in one episode as well, and is actually antagonistic. #$%
@#$ $#@ whens the episode about someone selling a statue and a t-shirt for $25k? #$%
@#$ $#@ Love the 4th wall jokes in the show, but Jesus Christ, why did this spin-off ruin shadow? #$%
@#$ $#@ the best part about this is it was apparently improved. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still can't tell if this is fake or it's real and my brain has subconsciously hit a new level of Denial #$%
@#$ $#@ Do they do him justice? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is he as edgy and "bad ass" as usual? #$%
@#$ $#@ that was the real airing list from about 6 weeks ago, yea #$%
@#$ $#@ Shadow is the edgiest hes been since his game. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit, that's good #$%
@#$ $#@ Its come to acquire some taste for once. #$%
@#$ $#@ These writers are /ourguys/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking damn thats actually really good #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you cut out the bit directly afterwards where a mysterious goo gets put on sonics forehead? #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember one where Thursday to Sunday it was nothing but TTG with a new episode of Mighty Magiswords on thrusday, a movie on Friday and another on saturday #$%
@#$ $#@ So is western animation just, dead? #$%
@#$ $#@ No fucking way this is true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why so much TTGO?. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will be once Samurai Jack ends in three weeks. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes, they really play up his edginess for laughs, however he is still a competent rival to Sonic and only lost because of Eggman. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish he was in more episodes #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is roger?. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its made in France, they can do whatever the hell they want there. #$%
@#$ $#@ goodbye doctor! #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, no wonder wakfu exists, god damn that thing is pure cock tease. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you want to cum on that blue rat? #$%
@#$ $#@ What poor taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still can't believe that we somehow memed Chris into the sonic universe #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit Knuckles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bill Nye BTFO by a children's cartoon #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah France. #$%
@#$ $#@ The last bastion of quality western animation. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats more believable, that a lot of people online share the same opinion as you, or that a cartoon is calling you out on your shit specifically? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you sure youre not thinking of Tweaker or whatever his name is? #$%
@#$ $#@ potato rhymes with eight-o #$%
@#$ $#@ "a potato clock" matches "up at eight o-clock", more specifically #$%
@#$ $#@ This looks familiar #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the joke was he just said what makes it a clock and forgets about the potato part entirely. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how G4 had a huge variety of shows, and then as the years went on it basically turned into 12 hours of ninja warrior and 12 hours of cops, and then just 24 hours of cops #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone got it off him from some discord channel, so I dont think it was that guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds more like one nasty rumor to me #$%
@#$ $#@ It may be, but rumors spread fast. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would suck if Sega got wind of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese companies hate any sort of risk #$%
@#$ $#@ Reruns of the most disposable shows are the death knell of a failing company. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah okay this sure doesnt sound like a lazy attempt at spreading malicious rumors. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its not worth vetting around. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rumors like that destroy peoples lives. #$%
@#$ $#@ Being hard to work with is nothing compared to that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, source. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seemed to spawn from sonic retros discord chat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont know much else. #$%
@#$ $#@ You stated, as if it were a fact, that he is "a fucking psychopath", then casually threw in that last statement worded as a question. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then also stated he was thrown out of After The Sequel for being hard to work with as if it were fact, then brushed it off as I dunno just something I heard. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is an incredibly lazy attempt to spread malicious rumors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont make claims that extreme unless you know for sure and have solid proof. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with pedophilia? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was waiting for the obligatory IRC post. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of that car wash scene in Chowder #$%
@#$ $#@ Delete dis #$%
@#$ $#@ Post more good show bits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im lurking this thread just for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats with cartoons these days? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do they really only have 4 shows left? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do we blame Canada or Cal Arts for this #$%
@#$ $#@ Canada gave us Ed Edd n Eddy, I say blame cal arts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs tv show die off already? #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing worth watching anymore is Gumball. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't really expect the tv show to go anywhere, and it apparently didn't. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a surprisingly solid show, I catch it sometimes when I'm flipping channels. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't think I've seen a bad episode. #$%
@#$ $#@ Need to take note of when its on ausfag TV so I can watch it more often. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some cartoon by the folk who brought you Ben 10 and Ultimate Spider-Man where Mega Man is a high schooler named Aki Light who turns into the super hero Mega Man to fight evil robots #$%
@#$ $#@ Speaking of French animation, does anyone know if the Ernest and Celestine TV series started yet? #$%
@#$ $#@ I heard about it being in the works like three years ago but never saw if it actually came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ ROUGHER THAN THE REST OF THEM #$%
@#$ $#@ what channels is it on in australia? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it on free TV ever? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds better than what Capcoms doing with him. #$%
@#$ $#@ It runs on Boomerang which no one fucking has. #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes like a month for hd feed to release because they air it on CN much later. #$%
@#$ $#@ At leastt WBB got a slot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, the show is still going on and its still getting got? #$%
@#$ $#@ new episodes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it #$%
@#$ $#@ sonic's a bee racist #$%
@#$ $#@ check your privilege, bro. #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking unbelievable #$%
@#$ $#@ That looks like a half-assed edit. #$%
@#$ $#@ also known as low budget CGI liquid #$%
@#$ $#@ Well what was it in the episode? #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont wanna know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kickass is down forever #$%
@#$ $#@ drool from pic related, an endangered animal which invaded sonics house. #$%
@#$ $#@ he wasn't allowed to live there again until the animal had found a suitable mate and finished the "courting ritual" #$%
@#$ $#@ Steven Universe is far worse than TTG could even pretend to be #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant you imagine non-stop crying and QUALITY height changes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty high. #$%
@#$ $#@ now thats gold #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont you pay attention? #$%
@#$ $#@ Any piece of media that references or creates a meme is automatically AMAZING. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the power of memes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, this is actually pretty funny. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are all of the episodes this good? #$%
@#$ $#@ The best part is that the joke can go either way, since he never actually mentions what color theyre using. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, that sounds about right to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ People can harp on about the voice direction all they want, but to me RCS is a complete non-fit for Sonic. #$%
@#$ $#@ because they embrace thicc while USA never will #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonic boom the last time Knuckles seen digging. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pollock posted it on his soundcloud over a year ago #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the voice actor, he's all edge and no substance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I dont like Charley or Nom-Nom, I stopped watching the show purely because I was getting fed up with their plot device asses getting shoved in my face all the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chloe was okay, because it seemed like she had some sort of character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because those are currently the only RIPs out. #$%
@#$ $#@ You might have to use a streaming website. #$%
@#$ $#@ It used to be on Nickelodeon, though very rarely and in the morning #$%
@#$ $#@ It varies, not all of them are this heavily referential #$%
@#$ $#@ like poisonous?? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck if i know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its supposed to be deviousness, probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ With the pun on "diva" stuck in there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does this actually make sense? #$%
@#$ $#@ Was she a diva and devious? #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't say, I haven't read those comics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jesus christ, Penders. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck? #$%
@#$ $#@ was this before or after jojo became a meme? #$%
@#$ $#@ It was in 2015. #$%
@#$ $#@ well thats alot less cool #$%
@#$ $#@ extratorrent is probably the most popular one right now, but i just use BitChe #$%
@#$ $#@ but that's not a jojo's reference you dimwitted fucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Half of it is a Jojo reference, the other half is FotNS #$%
@#$ $#@ oh fug! #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope Ken Penders never dies. #$%
@#$ $#@ He may have done irreparable damage to Archie but hes a goldmine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Say up at 8 oclock and a potato clock out loud. #$%
@#$ $#@ there's an occasional indirect cwc reference #$%
@#$ $#@ You know thats a quote from some real guy right #$%
@#$ $#@ It totally is but Chris is an exception. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, that's what's funny about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ They put a quote from the goddamn Holocaust in a childrens furry comic. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah this sums it up #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually laughed really hard at that. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the problem with changing their rules with Boomerang, all they do is just shove the lesser shows over to it to try and kill it prematurely while holding onto a small handful for the main channel. #$%
@#$ $#@ And then people start wondering why the fuck the timeslots look like this. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get it, can someone explain #$%
@#$ $#@ He also has a tiny mega man that lives in his head and controls him for some reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every time I see it I want to slam my face into a wall. #$%
@#$ $#@ No the problem is that CNs current management for the past 7 years or so is fucking retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who are the dog looking guys? #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently they started working on one sometime after the movie but I have no idea if it came out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im feeling the need to download this cartoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is everything this good, or is it just a handful of good moments spread out over a season? #$%
@#$ $#@ How horrifying. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sonic Boom is the Happy Place of a degenerate Sonic fan #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent you heard? #$%
@#$ $#@ IT'S YOUR NEW FAVORITE SHOW #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah it was erased from existence, you're looking at a rare specimen who still has access to this game on a far away galaxy and that somehow was able to find his way here to reminds us of a game long gone #$%
@#$ $#@ im interested in knowing why you guys like Tatsuya so much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes the most fleshed out protag in the Persona series. #$%
@#$ $#@ The trials he had to go through in IS and EP grow his character and personality to a degree that the other MCs never achieved. #$%
@#$ $#@ likes anal #$%
@#$ $#@ She's great and also Soejima's favorite. #$%
@#$ $#@ someone explain this anal meme #$%
@#$ $#@ It isnt just limited to /v/, but Makoto is the most popular choice pretty much everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nier is only attracting memers, not normalfags, actually theyre kind of the same person so nevermind. #$%
@#$ $#@ atlus masterwork #$%
@#$ $#@ We dont though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more like most of the fanbase in general loves her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes cute as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Daily reminder to completely disregard ann. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont try to reason with the Makoto ruined the game shitposter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Less cute than Sadayo! #$%
@#$ $#@ New one added to the collection. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much nailed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes almost like all the popular girls in the franchise rolled into one. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ loves worst girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like all the Rise shitters. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a quote in the game where she says she's 'going to leave the backdoor open for you' #$%
@#$ $#@ whose booty? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes the biggest waifubait and doing a good job at that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she reminds them of Iris. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wished they had made it obvious she was reading something completely asinine to drive the point further. #$%
@#$ $#@ those are PS3 screenshots though #$%
@#$ $#@ Hifumi is great #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah makotoers do that by themselves in- okay it isn't as bad here in /V/ but everywhere else macumto fans ruin message boards #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I knew I wouldn't romance her when this answer didn't even get me any upboats with her. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much of a party pooper unfunny cunt do you have to be to not laugh at this light hearted joke? #$%
@#$ $#@ Waifubait that the game throws at you #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there anyone else that gets something like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I know Joker gets the Metatron gun thats +5 to all but thats the closest Ive seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ People could do with taking something literally for once #$%
@#$ $#@ Ann couldn't win against Makoto my dude #$%
@#$ $#@ New fad, just like naoto was for P4 #$%
@#$ $#@ She's cuter what else do you need #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even close dunce. #$%
@#$ $#@ Iris is garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto is great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personality matters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah so Iris is better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off you and your mediocre game #$%
@#$ $#@ Its only natural. #$%
@#$ $#@ tomboys are too pure for this world #$%
@#$ $#@ I constantly use them both. #$%
@#$ $#@ Morgana is crit machine with luck build and Makoto abilities is too good. #$%
@#$ $#@ On that note, does Yusuke lose usefulness later? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because around lv30-ish he seems like Ryuji's straight upgrade, but I don't see many people keeping him around. #$%
@#$ $#@ No she wouldn't there's a difference between yakuzas and some dumb model #$%
@#$ $#@ Must be a rule of nature. #$%
@#$ $#@ Higher MP Pool and Crit Rate, but he lacks Ryujis buffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ AND THEY RUN WHEN THE SUN COMES UP #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you are right #$%
@#$ $#@ You know it #$%
@#$ $#@ I personally ended up liking her more than I would have thought, since I didnt originally care much about her going into the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I do agree that her confidant is kind of shit and as a character, shes a lot more tame than her phantom thief outfit suggests. #$%
@#$ $#@ Low effort bait my dude #$%
@#$ $#@ just because she isnt a punk rebel in every scene doesnt null and void her awakening anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ shes still a good girl on the surface. #$%
@#$ $#@ No wonder she is absolute shit, just like Toriyama and Lightning fanaticism. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm so glad that she's my wife #$%
@#$ $#@ Chie is boring compared to Yukiko though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can I still fugg the Imouto? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nigger what the fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto slaps her friend instead of the gay host. #$%
@#$ $#@ because her friend was being an idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ When Makoto threatened to beat up the gay host he ran away. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is she so angry when she fights #$%
@#$ $#@ Its strange that they stopped giving her any physical attacks after Flash Bomb. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe theyll fix that in the updated rerelease like how P4G did. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish Hifumi had more interesting shit to her confidant. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's like one of the cutest girls in the entire game but I don't give a single fuck about shogi and dumb chuuni attitudes. #$%
@#$ $#@ chie didnt have to punch yukiko for being an idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want her to beat me up #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing wrong with eating cake #$%
@#$ $#@ shes ment to be the better long term healer than morgana so I doubt it. #$%
@#$ $#@ maybe she should have #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto is not a violent thug, you know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes is very polite, level-headed and well-mannered. #$%
@#$ $#@ But she also hates being manipulated by others and pretending to be a perfect girl for the sake of others. #$%
@#$ $#@ She enjoys reading books and touring in her free time, thats how she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thats what makes her a good character. #$%
@#$ $#@ She is also a great spy #$%
@#$ $#@ Naoto being the Light/Dark/Almighty user in 4 didnt stop them from giving her fucking everything in Golden. #$%
@#$ $#@ shit opinion #$%
@#$ $#@ The best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does she call you Dark Flame Master? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would probably walk out if I was playing a game with someone and they said all that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can handle a lot of fake anime bullshit, but not the chuuni stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ And don't forget cake #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish i could have a confidant with her friend instead of her #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto is by far the most popular character from the game aside from Joker. #$%
@#$ $#@ In terms of the girls it goes something like Makoto &gt; Kawakami &gt; Futaba &gt; Ann &gt; Haru. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to make Haru happy! #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto and Futaba still dwarf Haru in terms of amount of fan art, and shes the least popular girl in the main party. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its nice that she abandons her Chuuni ways at the end of her Confidant. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know, I thought it was kind of cute #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Mishima #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck i would love having her running the website and fangirling about the phantom thieves #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck Ryuji is my best friend forever. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a lot more fun than playing with min-maxing autists #$%
@#$ $#@ Can Yusuke do 3k on a boss with charge #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona at her computer #$%
@#$ $#@ kids loves robots #$%
@#$ $#@ Play baseball and read. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tae is also an option, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Delete this #$%
@#$ $#@ I have no clue who this character even is without Googling him. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont get a romantic vibe between Futaba and Yusuke. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its more like Yusuke is the second least normie person so she can bully him. #$%
@#$ $#@ They're both eccentrics and tease each other constantly, giving up potential tsundere vibes #$%
@#$ $#@ He's a big boy #$%
@#$ $#@ absolutely perfect #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait a second... #$%
@#$ $#@ Haru deserves someone who loves her. #$%
@#$ $#@ yusuke is for midgame #$%
@#$ $#@ She does, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Akechi had a hard life. #$%
@#$ $#@ No he didn't #$%
@#$ $#@ Baton pass to him and I'm damn sure he can #$%
@#$ $#@ Poor Hifumi #$%
@#$ $#@ The cat dies #$%
@#$ $#@ The pleasure of being cummed inside. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id say Haru is more popular than Futaba and Ann. #$%
@#$ $#@ IIRC its right after she gets Johanna. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just there to explain why she has a bitching bike. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Mishima. #$%
@#$ $#@ She isnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a few vocal people about her around here, but that's no indication of her actual popularity. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's definitely the least popular party member, which isn't really her fault, it's the fact that she barely has a presence in the game that's the problem. #$%
@#$ $#@ whoa it's almost as if Makoto is a gender neutral name that's often used for female characters that share a ton of traits with one another #$%
@#$ $#@ Not just the Thieves, but second most popular character overall now that Goros fallen out of favor. #$%
@#$ $#@ mmmmm Spats #$%
@#$ $#@ Mishima is such an autistic faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst S.Link in franchise history. #$%
@#$ $#@ That we should accept our loneliness and wait to either die or for Thirds to come along so we dont have to bother with Dating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bitch doesnt want to be called Witch, fucking damnit. #$%
@#$ $#@ You only like him because hes an autistic nobody like you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, why even bother coming back? #$%
@#$ $#@ You knew what was waiting for you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you really want to say "I knew it" that badly? #$%
@#$ $#@ A regular license #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt hit me until the other day that Princess Leia had something similar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothing mindblowing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes just a nobody who got some delusions of grandeur for like 5 whole minutes. #$%
@#$ $#@ So who did you waifu? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not my pic #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course he did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Giving Arsene Cadenza makes Orpheus actually useful for once. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes the most boring class prez I ever seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Contrast to the rest, mostly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes basically the only girl that actually gets any amounts of non-generic character outside of handful of slink cutscenes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modulate this by the fact that she's a member of the main team and the fact that she has the best body and there's really nothing left to say. #$%
@#$ $#@ Best boy #$%
@#$ $#@ From where are you guys pulling these concept arts from? #$%
@#$ $#@ From the artbook #$%
@#$ $#@ While I like the bottom right design a lot it doesnt feel very Persona-ish to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems more like a design youd see in SMTIV. #$%
@#$ $#@ The existence of fast travel seriously degraded Persona 5 for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes good for levelling charm though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Joker is great, easily the best boy in the game #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me of Shinji #$%
@#$ $#@ Every Persona has fast travel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I could never make it past that god damn puzzle. #$%
@#$ $#@ From bait to complete seriousness #$%
@#$ $#@ How is it SJW propaganda? #$%
@#$ $#@ But they are? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure Jamal #$%
@#$ $#@ At this point I cant tell if this is a meme or supposed to be serious... #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, its obvious... #$%
@#$ $#@ Either this is a joke or everyone else to play Infinite is fucking retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wel, to be fair... #$%
@#$ $#@ Columbus did think he was in fucking India. #$%
@#$ $#@ THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: WIND WAKER #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre gonna have to try harder than that. #$%
@#$ $#@ convoluted != deep #$%
@#$ $#@ jews in disguise, every single one of them #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah your mom's pussy is a good example lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the reason I couldn't finish Ergo Proxy #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe if youre thinking with your penis. #$%
@#$ $#@ i did enjoy it and it was a nice, bittersweet story, but you do not need to do any reading between the lines if you've played nier and read notes throughout automata #$%
@#$ $#@ This is my GOTY so far but no, unless you're a total retard the story is fairly straightforward and the themes are fairly obvious #$%
@#$ $#@ Jews are white #$%
@#$ $#@ You could say that about literally every video game. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is this one different from any other game with a white villain? #$%
@#$ $#@ I played the game years ago I only remember it being shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Agreed you would have to have an IQ over 130 to finish this fucking puzzle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looking for triforce pieces was impossible #$%
@#$ $#@ So basically you pulled the she stuff out of your ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is why I cant take these kinds of accusations seriously anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ You fuckers throw she around the way they throw the word rape around. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about an actual game that requires an IQ of 130+ ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this what you meant op? #$%
@#$ $#@ I did it multiple times and my average seems to be around 260. #$%
@#$ $#@ The lowest average of 5 I got was 235. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh thats right the click delay. #$%
@#$ $#@ let me retry it. #$%
@#$ $#@ My average is 260. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre white when they want to show whitey that they should feel guilty and non-white when somebody expects THEM to feel guilty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tokido is a treasure #$%
@#$ $#@ well you certainly needed a high boredom threshold #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldnt finish that game, was too busy jerking off. #$%
@#$ $#@ how is your post relevant to his post you fucking idiot? #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember so many people hyping it up and when I finally did watch it I found a 5/10 at best, but then again the anime "community" is full of autistic otakus who love indulging in "philosophy" and "science" #$%
@#$ $#@ i had professors teaching me that cuba and soviet union were paradise on earth but WHO AM I to disagree with them right it's not like i'm a professor or something i can't have opinions and they can't be wrong #$%
@#$ $#@ i have shit reaction time but got like a 135 on a mensa iq test #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking didnt though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I usually get around 175 though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of us are just genetically superior. #$%
@#$ $#@ Xenogears and Xenosaga #$%
@#$ $#@ This, or TIS-100 #$%
@#$ $#@ This is to robot stories what Mass Effect was to space operas, a completely creatively bankrupt take on it using absolutely every single cliche every other story of its kind used. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reminds me that I really need to finish those. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah, sorry, youre waifu is very le cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre mad, that would never work. #$%
@#$ $#@ mfw 170ms with 3 hours of sleep #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt Levine wrote this without having full comprehension of the theory of relativity of time or of basic Quantum Mechanics? #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent played the game, but if so is the case it seems that it may be a display of impressing naive players rather than clever writing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not pre-Empyrean EVE Online, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ One of the main villains is black. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not since 2.0. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the returning players have destroyed the matchmaking in all modes. #$%
@#$ $#@ modders realized it wouldn't make it less shit so they didn't bother #$%
@#$ $#@ I like Spore, I still launch it up from time to time. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know it was a letdown, but when I was younger I loved to create stuff and still do. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't hype video games cause I'm not an overgrown child. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fable 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ hey bro I prepurchased it too. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had fun for the first few days #$%
@#$ $#@ I was hyped and even pre-ordered MGSV but I wasnt burned by it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still play it a lot. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you didnt like it, why did you play it for 400 hours? #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 Total war... #$%
@#$ $#@ If they just made Rome 1 with better graphics the game would have been solid. #$%
@#$ $#@ They said they had 80% more money to use on this title from the last one in the series, well they must have used it on marketing alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ it literally did tho #$%
@#$ $#@ Rome 2 Total War #$%
@#$ $#@ The creature phase is literally the only good part, and current me doesn't even find the creature part that fun anymore #$%
@#$ $#@ I got the collectors edition and all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking piece of shit game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The quest system was such a crock of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I hated how it felt/controlled from day 1, but I still think to this day that it is the most attractive visual style ever used in an FPS and that carried it for me for about 10 hours of game time. #$%
@#$ $#@ same, I was so disappointed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a theme park MMO with none of the difficulty and creativity of GW1 #$%
@#$ $#@ Zero Time Dilemma #$%
@#$ $#@ Because he has legitimate mental problems. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey, the same exact thing happened to me with GTA IV. #$%
@#$ $#@ What problems did it fix? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it looks better but it still has level scaling out the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ In fact modding Oblivion to get rid of level scaling and making the character models look nicer significantly improves it. #$%
@#$ $#@ As for Skyrim you really can't mod out it's problems, its still a boring, shallow game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Society obviously cant control hype. #$%
@#$ $#@ GTA Online is probably my vote for most wasted potential of any game ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still had some fun with it but with only a few changes to what they already have I feel like it could have been incredible. #$%
@#$ $#@ They never will thought because lol shark cards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dragon Age 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved DA:O, and up until this point, I felt as though Bioware could do no wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I know how Obi-Wan felt. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Wii as a whole was the biggest disappointment. #$%
@#$ $#@ I ignored the stupid name and what I thought was slightly weaker tech for a console that would revolutionize the way we controlled video games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Specifically, Red Steel. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked fable2 though, only sad thing about it was the boss fight, but everything else was pretty great #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, come on, LL had some good stuff in it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pavel is the best thing about the series. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brink was the first game I ever preordered. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Git the modded one #$%
@#$ $#@ all the mods are dong. #$%
@#$ $#@ akabur broke my soul:- #$%
@#$ $#@ X Rebirth. #$%
@#$ $#@ I bet I know why. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd bet a hundred bucks it was made as gimped as it was so that it'd easily fit in an ensemble pack-- ie, Mario Sports Superstars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never again #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucker at my local electronics store said it would be the next Quake. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I didnt learn my lesson because few years later I got Operation Racoon City. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was so certain it would be good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was so upset I was so stupid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent had a drip of hype again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been hype free for over 4 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im ashamed to admit I was hyped for this. #$%
@#$ $#@ The original game on the Neo Geo Pocket Color was fun as fuck, this was just a goddamn travesty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thiaf never stood a chance. #$%
@#$ $#@ How could you be so blinded? #$%
@#$ $#@ This and yoooooooookalayleeeeeeeeee, fuck these games were such a disappointment #$%
@#$ $#@ unless you're autistic there's no reason why a grown man would ever enjoy a game made specifically for children #$%
@#$ $#@ And now I know that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I checked the Smash site first thing every morning and bought a Wii specifically. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was the only game Ive ever preordered and to this day I never let myself get into prerelease hype for a game beyond casual acknowledgment of potential interest. #$%
@#$ $#@ Smash 4 doesn't interest me in the slightest #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't think anyone who even was a casual fan of the original Thief games could see anything good or improved in 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont understand what happened. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looked cool for like five minutes #$%
@#$ $#@ I got pretty hyped for Sim City back in 2013. #$%
@#$ $#@ Worst thing was I knew how shit EA were and should have seen the warning signs but was still suckered in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels bad man #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah Elite Dangerous. #$%
@#$ $#@ I even bought Horizons. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was so hype but the game felt empty quick. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is so little online interaction. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like a solo game that turned halfway its developpement into a MMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ MGSV followed by Zero Time Dilemma. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill never fucking get hyped again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Diablo 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Zero Time Dilemma, hands down. #$%
@#$ $#@ I regret all those hours spent in circlejerking in hype threads, checking the twitter for new info, using my extremely limited japanese to try to decipher japanese magazine scans... #$%
@#$ $#@ What a fucking shitshow. #$%
@#$ $#@ This game is great #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, it really makes you think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its rare that a game manages to intilectually stemulate a man of my intilligence level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Finally a smart game for us smart gamers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jamal honey, you watch anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only game I've ever preordered in my life was Metroid: Other M #$%
@#$ $#@ Im kind of satisfied with what I got out of it though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not the game, its still failed potential and broken dreams, but the old /sbg/ threads that were fueled entirely by anger and porn were fairly entertaining, well worth the cost of being burned by a mediocre game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I often wonder what TES would be like now if instead of Cyrodil TESIV was the morrowind mainland. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fell for that shit once, nevar again. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent bought into anything fully priced this decade because im not a retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games are either shit from the beginning,have terrible launches,die soon after or shit on the prequels so hard it makes you think if its still the same series. #$%
@#$ $#@ I played Red Steel for the first time like a year ago and it was the funniest shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mass Effect 3, I learned to never anticipate things ever again #$%
@#$ $#@ My hype level went from "Deluxe Edition Preorder" to "not even going to watch the cutscenes on Youtube" in the month leading up to release, thanks to /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not one man that ruined Spore though. #$%
@#$ $#@ You and me both anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Tiberian Sun. #$%
@#$ $#@ After the awesomeness of C&amp;C I could not wait for things to get even better in the next installment. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just mediocre. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have not been hyped since because its pointless. #$%
@#$ $#@ rome 2 was fucking awful, naval battles are appalling wtf #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked AWL, it had an end and semi-story. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was a neat twist #$%
@#$ $#@ is this loss #$%
@#$ $#@ is this 9gag? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never really over hype anything but with Paper Mario: Sticker Star. #$%
@#$ $#@ I saw those beta screenshots when it was first announced with the turn-based combat, Chain Chomp partner, card area &amp; etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ and it got me ecstatic since I loved the other games, my big reason for getting a 3DS was it no less. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit though, was that a mistake to do, I never thought the game would be so disappointing and shitty, Ive made sure never to get that hyped ever again, fuck that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was super, super fucking hyped when I saw the trailer, then It all died as soon as I found out EA was making it and they werent including space battles. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still remember that day very well. #$%
@#$ $#@ It thought it was going to be next-gen Oblivon, with the same leap that Morrowind had to Oblivon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just diet Oblivon with really bad humor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bulletstorm was a slightly above mediocre game with a decently fun gimmick. #$%
@#$ $#@ A great choice if you didnt buy it at full price. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him but I agree with you there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gay Tony was the last time I felt the spark of 'old GTA'. #$%
@#$ $#@ GTA 5 was just sour, mean sported and generally unpleasant, and Im fully expecting 6 to be an open world MMO game with instanced story missions for single player. #$%
@#$ $#@ Assassins Creed 3, and I only let myself get excited about certain games now. #$%
@#$ $#@ hmm lets seee hmmmm probably your mum hmmmmmmm #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a tie between Mass Effect 3 and Final Fantasy XV. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd like to say I have, but I probably haven't. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked armikrog #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't hate it but it's absolute turds compared to its predecessor. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am sorry I dont like this not really good game. #$%
@#$ $#@ On the other hand, atleast Torment: ToN was maazing. #$%
@#$ $#@ that is the fate of games that get made on crowd fund money #$%
@#$ $#@ Would be easy enough to implement. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you go a week without doing something for said guild, you lose your status. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its actually kind of amazing how little the leaders of each guild have to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Their entire role is pretty much pointless. #$%
@#$ $#@ As someone who went into the game completely blind, We can learn a lot from that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tied for best looking system. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, and it has an awesome controller. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah even though MGSV sucked ass, my PS4 looks fly as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Indeed it does. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually managed to get the Destiny console without having to pay for the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since it was missing, it went for 200 bucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mirrors edge catalyst #$%
@#$ $#@ Assuming BL2 means Borderlands, what was the issue you had with it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The biggest issue I had was the limited gun supply and lack of variety in the weapons youd find. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fallout 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ The third post ITT was Star Fox Zero. #$%
@#$ $#@ I searched "Star fox zero" so that space between "star" and "fox" really fucked everything up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even then, its an okay game. #$%
@#$ $#@ But what a massive disappointment after the years of hype and trailers. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually enjoyed BRINK ;_; #$%
@#$ $#@ Bioshock Infinite #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I was hype for Brink too, but I never buy early, I always wait it out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty disappointing tho. #$%
@#$ $#@ can't he just shut the fuck up #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to sleep #$%
@#$ $#@ You're so gorgeous, Panther #$%
@#$ $#@ This one always sounds so creepy #$%
@#$ $#@ You can do this! #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a Rouge thread now? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you honestly think it wouldnt turn into this? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna breed Rouge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cus he's a fatass lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ some spinoff #$%
@#$ $#@ I definitely wish we had a Riders that focused purely on gameplay, like Sonic All-Stars Racing duology and Mario Kart series. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anyone who's dumping is still around, I'd appreciate more like this one #$%
@#$ $#@ Not like discussion has a place here right? #$%
@#$ $#@ Rouge gets a LOT of Giantess Art. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it reuses songs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just bought this on ebay #$%
@#$ $#@ does there need to be discussion? #$%
@#$ $#@ well shit I'm severely conflicted #$%
@#$ $#@ Zero gravity felt like it was missing a lot of the freedom of choice that the first one had. #$%
@#$ $#@ But it was alright. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually quite liked the first one though. #$%
@#$ $#@ link please #$%
@#$ $#@ Wrist rests aren't big enough #$%
@#$ $#@ LINK GODDAMNIT #$%
@#$ $#@ She is the best mom 10/10 would let her spoil me with sweets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Word, Rouge is pretty good though. #$%
@#$ $#@ We NEED a Styx game based in Sonic lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might as well #$%
@#$ $#@ I just nostalgiad everywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ Link anywhere? #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldn't find anything on the guy's twitter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or is it patreon only? #$%
@#$ $#@ sweet dolphin.exe #$%
@#$ $#@ I had no problem with first act, cleared all quests in half time, but I cant stand having that looming over my head in the main campaign. #$%
@#$ $#@ good game that aside though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres a quest where you need to retrieve a wooden statuette from a thief in Denmark. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dismembered the thief so hard with an axe, that his corpse disappeared and I never got his loot, LMAO. #$%
@#$ $#@ Reloading and trying again fixed the issue, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats what I did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Drink mead, you fucking milk-drinker. #$%
@#$ $#@ being a top tier blacksmith youll always weave a random attribute into items. #$%
@#$ $#@ the first one had a linux version, go see maybe this one'll have too #$%
@#$ $#@ All morale changes are permanent as far as I have seen even for the player character. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you clean every time youll soon have -10 moraledev oversight that main player character has morale and therefore less physical and mental resistance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only way to fix it is with console commands. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's fucking retarded, I'll wait for a patch then before actually playing this further, even though I already own the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ her sister is superior. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cant you just save before rolling the custom characters and keep rerolling till you get the ones you want? #$%
@#$ $#@ Name of the fucking game dipshits?! #$%
@#$ $#@ is this a joke? #$%
@#$ $#@ the OP pic has very big text spelling the name yknow. #$%
@#$ $#@ I disable images on 4chan as they often contain disturbing content. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a fag #$%
@#$ $#@ Well why he fuck are you browsing an image board then you fucking doofus. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is my favourite post of the year, hands down. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't know shit about this game but if the timer is client based you're guaranteed to be able to freeze it with something like cheat engine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a cheat engine noob, so thats not easy, there no way of telling the value on the timer. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's definitely not based on hours as I've tried to do it that way. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss the shameless traced celebrity faces in conq. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only face I recognized so far was an autistic youtuber. #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent seen gore posted outside of a pink board in years. #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds sweet #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking newfag, drink bleach. #$%
@#$ $#@ forgot pic #$%
@#$ $#@ someone is descartes, way too long ago to remember specifics. #$%
@#$ $#@ nah, that was an edit somebody made here #$%
@#$ $#@ Hearty chuckle. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really liked conquistadors, is this any good? #$%
@#$ $#@ not a huge fan of vikings though #$%
@#$ $#@ While Im at it, how is the cruelty potential in this game compared to conquistador? #$%
@#$ $#@ That flat &gt; all #$%
@#$ $#@ Succubus Mercy is fucking shit, she also has a dick bulge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Witch Mercy never got pregnant so her breasts never grew. #$%
@#$ $#@ That costume isnt canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's more of a "what if" #$%
@#$ $#@ What are you gay? #$%
@#$ $#@ default mercy's outfit has a plate thing that just outlines the general shape of her tits while the devil one is like a tighter to the skin type of thing #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually approve of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Loose clothing looks bad on both men and women though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Form fitting/enhancing attire has always been the gold standard. #$%
@#$ $#@ i havent even played overwatch but i know all the characters names because of r34 #$%
@#$ $#@ Straight men like hot lesbians though. #$%
@#$ $#@ padded armor to protect boobies? #$%
@#$ $#@ Gold standard sure, but since every game has visible boobs on every female char it makes the value of gold inflated. #$%
@#$ $#@ By that logic, were all naked. #$%
@#$ $#@ You fucking slut. #$%
@#$ $#@ cry some more #$%
@#$ $#@ Inferiority complex. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre mad that their tanks were worse than German and Allies tanks. #$%
@#$ $#@ are you even trying at this point my man #$%
@#$ $#@ le samegfag #$%
@#$ $#@ Panzer III and IVs suck the biggest nonsense in this game its unreal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then I unlocked the Tiger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Name four good games made in the past ten years made by a team of more than 10 people. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a retarded, arbitrary set of conditions. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are your favourite games, Anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ You couldve just said weeb trash Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know most people in UKistan have a poor grasp on English, but you should try to understand the difference between have and had, Pajeet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go to school. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frontier are still around, dominating the space sim genre #$%
@#$ $#@ even French make better games than bongs #$%
@#$ $#@ That is actually a terrible Dragon Ball game you weeb trash. #$%
@#$ $#@ A real man plays Fusions. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what happens when you use the console generation to fill the thread #$%
@#$ $#@ Because you didn't stay on /mu/ #$%
@#$ $#@ That is actually correct. #$%
@#$ $#@ All the good threads get dropped like a sack of bricks and all the shitty recursive once-a-days are the only things alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I miss olde-/v/. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah it's weird for a company that's been going for so long to not know the first rule of economics but to be fair they practically constructed their new building out of unsold wii u's so it's understandable to a certain degree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Around me, preorders sold out about a week after they went up #$%
@#$ $#@ such as? #$%
@#$ $#@ Marin is not Zelda. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, Marin looks like shit in Hyrule Warriors, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ to THIS??? #$%
@#$ $#@ That this world is shit and we should all escape. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nintendo is trying to save us from the Demiurge. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marin is _____________ #$%
@#$ $#@ A Seagull #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck that fish #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm glad she's dead #$%
@#$ $#@ DELETE THIS #$%
@#$ $#@ That's not Link the twink though, Link used to be somewhat manly #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm saying about this Link #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi JoshCube #$%
@#$ $#@ What would Miphas caviar taste like? #$%
@#$ $#@ The best girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ Zelda was clearly giving Link a mutual 'thank you' hug. #$%
@#$ $#@ Farore is best Goddess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes cute, and believes in Link. #$%
@#$ $#@ to this?? #$%
@#$ $#@ They just met then too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hundreds of years asleep made that Zelda thirsty for Linkdick. #$%
@#$ $#@ Din, hands down. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mipha's Grace is ready~ #$%
@#$ $#@ didn't she have to go and fuck twilight land #$%
@#$ $#@ Link is canon gay and her brother is a million times better anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ I give you better partner of Link #$%
@#$ $#@ Bullying Lynels for fun! #$%
@#$ $#@ Lots of Lon-Lon Milk and sedentary sitting on your ass as a sage. #$%
@#$ $#@ err, fix #$%
@#$ $#@ because shes best girl? #$%
@#$ $#@ she and Link were childhood friends, so I doubt the dynamic was quite like that #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd imagine it wasn't unrequited. #$%
@#$ $#@ Link just had a lot going on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Link is just that one guy who believes really hard in doing what fate has meant for him to do instead of just trying to live a normal life. #$%
@#$ $#@ This exactly. #$%
@#$ $#@ LA is one of the worst Zeldas to date, but its the hipster + nostalgia choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ BotW Zelda is the best girl in the series #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking OP as shit in Hyrule Warriors. #$%
@#$ $#@ God damn! #$%
@#$ $#@ Malon smells. #$%
@#$ $#@ No way would he sleep with her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone smells in medieval times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Urbosa is for motherhood not for waifu #$%
@#$ $#@ This looks like Kingdom Hearts. #$%
@#$ $#@ SEX with purahs candy pussy! #$%
@#$ $#@ It is painfully obvious that she was very much in love with Link, and perhaps he with her. #$%
@#$ $#@ But in the end, she knew her duty to her people came first. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shattering the mirror meant Hyrule would never again have to suffer an invasion of Twilight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Midna is a shockingly strong female character that nobody talks about. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also sexy as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ The children are also very cute in this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually with what we now know from SS and BotW about the link between Zelda and Link, they canonically fuck in every game, no matter what. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, even these two. #$%
@#$ $#@ Supposedly the romance part of the game was slapped onto the localization but I dont know how true that is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Midnas pretty popular regardless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe shes in heels? #$%
@#$ $#@ In the model? #$%
@#$ $#@ No, shes taller than Link even accounting for footwear. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm looking for the model sheet that shows all of the models side by side but I'm having difficulty finding it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well Zelda ought to wise up and become Marin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Marin was the dreamworlds manifestation of Zelda. #$%
@#$ $#@ the homo-eroticism on /v/ has got to stop #$%
@#$ $#@ TP Link is stated to be a direct bloodline relation to OoT Link, so he canonically had children with someone. #$%
@#$ $#@ MM happened in the mind of Skullkid #$%
@#$ $#@ Zelda pls #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice original work, Nintendo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not real, even in a fictional universe #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd cum on her eggs if she asked me to and gave me some hot JOI #$%
@#$ $#@ Youd cum on her eggs even if she asked you not to. #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats just a theory! #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this real? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does the fish have tits? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea, but its not from Zelda. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's a dolphin, not a fish #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does the dolphin have tits? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because shes not popular. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tragic romance, tropical islands are romantic, and theres a kind of charming innocence about the whole thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ She shattered the mirror because she gave in to fear. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zelda and Link believed that the two realms could stay connected and learn to be at peace, but Midna didnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Din, but is that really supposed to be Farore? #$%
@#$ $#@ I would expect Farore being the lifegiver and all to be a motherly milf #$%
@#$ $#@ Stupid sexy healslut #$%
@#$ $#@ pls no bully #$%
@#$ $#@ They are both women in Zelda games. #$%
@#$ $#@ While thinking about how you just destroyed an entire island full of people, including a girl who trusted you and was probably in love with you! #$%
@#$ $#@ He did op make this thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is he some sort of...faggots? #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting beat up by little girls is one of my dreams. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would they call him Shoe Ch*nko then? #$%
@#$ $#@ JA2 is hard to play if youre just going into it now... #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just so old on some technical things. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre never going to get rid of that feeling regardless of how good you get. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just make sure you save regularly and when you first start make sure you understand the UI and general game rules. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also start with something simpler than JA2. #$%
@#$ $#@ X-COM UFO Defense might still be sort of overwhelming but its quite a bit simpler than JA2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id advise you to pick this game up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Attack at night. #$%
@#$ $#@ You could also try hitting other towns than the airport #$%
@#$ $#@ 1.13 lets you make 6 IMPs and has a ridiculous number of customization options, including the option to disable Drassen counterattack or make it less severe. #$%
@#$ $#@ redpill me on this t. #$%
@#$ $#@ guy who's only played mechcomm2 but played 7.62 high caliber and enjoyed himself #$%
@#$ $#@ now this was the shit, one of my fav game #$%
@#$ $#@ There are multiple resolutions to choose from, 1.13 has the widescreen mod integrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ X-COM UFO Defense and Terror From the Deep with OpenXCOM also have no problem with resolutions as theyre basically recreated in a custom modern engine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aight that was a good enough sell to warrant a try. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks brah. #$%
@#$ $#@ good taste my man #$%
@#$ $#@ So I have to install that 1.13 mod to the gog version to fix my resolution complaint? #$%
@#$ $#@ Similar to 7.62 but not as open world. #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds pretty fucking badass. #$%
@#$ $#@ I missed when manuals were good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will never forget the redneck rampage manual. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that racism? #$%
@#$ $#@ this + xenonauts #$%
@#$ $#@ Xenonauts doesn't really do anything better than the game it's emulating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might as well just play UFO Defense. #$%
@#$ $#@ The game doesnt even look any better despite having better graphics because of its shitty art style. #$%
@#$ $#@ May not have been as good as Blood or Duke Nukem 3D, but it had character, and that's something modern shooters are sorely missing #$%
@#$ $#@ gotta agree with the other dudes. #$%
@#$ $#@ xenonauts wasnt a bad idea but then I learned about openxcom and now I have no need for it. #$%
@#$ $#@ God I hope they dont fuck up Battletech. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just worry a lot of people getting into the game expecting a Shadowrun Returns-style RPG when thats not what HBS is aiming for. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a freeware game dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tech tree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of the tech tree options are relic items that can only be equipped by one Templar at a time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Game has a very 40k feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's based on a book so it's as linear as it can get. #$%
@#$ $#@ More reason for it to be sold on GoG, since GoG literally sells air to retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mech games have had a shit run the last... #$%
@#$ $#@ 10 years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Posting more Star Traders because its GOTYAY. #$%
@#$ $#@ abandonware has never been legal #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't like change for change's sake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Xenonauts was exactly what it promised, but yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ It needed more variety. #$%
@#$ $#@ And proper art budget. #$%
@#$ $#@ Both of which they apparently have covered for the sequel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Customizing my dudes. #$%
@#$ $#@ MWO is a shit game because of the shit balancing and The PIG being lazy, but the core mechanics are very good, pretty much the best in the franchise. #$%
@#$ $#@ MW5 has a lot of potential, but its fucking PIG, so even though the core mechanics will most likely will be very good, it will be a skeleton of a game with the absolute minimum viable effort put into it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ho great, it's the "I have 93535 hours in this game, and I can tell you it's SHIT!" #$%
@#$ $#@ I want Deidranna to rape me while Elliot watches #$%
@#$ $#@ I play MWO all day just because I like it so much #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, its so good, nobody plays it and all the player leagues are either skeletons or dead and buried. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thing stressed me the fuck out like no other tactical game ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I use my vita every single day to watch yt videos in bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty interesting how yt on vita doesn't have any ads lol #$%
@#$ $#@ I am still playing Kid Icarus Uprising. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't tell you why, but there's something about the game that keeps me into it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Starting to get into the 8.5-9 difficulties, so thats cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4U, definitely. #$%
@#$ $#@ The cutscenes really got me into it, and I don't think I've ever been that excited about videogames since playing it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gen is way too easy except for some bullshit Deviants pull and the fetch quests can be really annoying, and I didnt get to play a lot of 3U yet but I find myself missing the verticality a lot outside of the water battles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Played Metal Slug and Samurai Shodown, wanted to see how NeoGeo looked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes the 3DS is /comfy/ #$%
@#$ $#@ You never get MH Generations #$%
@#$ $#@ Has anyone in thread played Soma Bringer I heard there was a translation patch for it I may look for it if it's worth it #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ I own the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Playing persona 5 on my vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit is comfy! #$%
@#$ $#@ Buyer's Remorse: The Post #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah you just said you were playing MH4U I should have thought you could play it after MHG #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh fuck, this is all great advice. #$%
@#$ $#@ I appreciate it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, how about making armor/weapons? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can hack the vita now i believe #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a Handheld console discussion though #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon probably means they updated. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but only if you are attractive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont spoonfeed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Find your own shit to hate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Vitas are getting cheap now, Im considering getting one for Disgaea 3, 4 and Persona 4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should I? #$%
@#$ $#@ Citra works now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good stuff, man. #$%
@#$ $#@ How do you know all of this stuff, though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Experience, or research? #$%
@#$ $#@ Now, do you have to care? #$%
@#$ $#@ Most people around you dont really give a shit though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't think you won't get an occasional stare though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've never had anyone come up to me and scoff and I'm fat, hairy, and ugly as all fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess most people just assume I'm some sort of gorilla that escaped from the zoo and don't want to get my attention lest I throw my shit at them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea, Caligula, p4g, gensokyou wanderers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you are not fat or creepy, and most importantly only if you are not an adult. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think it depends on the setting really. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean if its break time, during a car trip, or on public transportion why not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eating lunch with a group of co workers and playing if you finish first, awkward. #$%
@#$ $#@ During a wedding, funeral, or waiting on a job interview, fuck no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sitting alone on a bench in a busy park when you dont have any kids, your about to get your ass beat or arrested. #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesnt take much common sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, one correction: the 6-move combo I mentioned might be written like that on Gen only and require a slightly different set of key presses on 4U. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't played SnS in 4U lately as much, I'm playing Adept SnS exclusively in Gen, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ dude of course they arent going to SAY anything, how autistic are you? #$%
@#$ $#@ They probably think you're autistic and don't want you to tard out on them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it possible to install PSP games with their own bubble? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm stuck with the EU version of MHFU when /mhg/ uses the US version for PPSSPP, and I'd like to not go hopping around with a save converter every time when transfering saves. #$%
@#$ $#@ ok now you're jus baitin #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm just triggered by the fact you don't use headphones. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats just rude man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe hes black. #$%
@#$ $#@ no, no "but" or anything, just no #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I'm doing, US to EU results in save corruption. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude that is fishy as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess you have to have a look to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Parents around here care about stranger danger stuff and a grown man playing video games alone sitting by playground equipment sends off lots of red flags. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre autistic assholes as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but see, you didnt specify playground stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can't speak for him, but at the very least I personally don't immediately think of playgrounds when I think of parks. #$%
@#$ $#@ If anything, there might be a short concrete walking trail in addition to the occasional benches, but thats it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again disrespectful as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ As a rule of thumb if you wouldn't like others doing it to you it's probably not something you should do to others #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah parks were I live around are just playgrounds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Should have specified. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bait a little harder next time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of us live in big cities that dont have what you would consider parks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a huge fan of my 3DS, personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its collected dust for years. #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time I turned it on was to play Link Between Worlds, and I didnt even finish the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are absolutely NOT like Persona, and their music is fucking amazing you piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only difference between 2DS and 3DS is 2DS is a bit tougher and more hoops to jump through if you hack your system. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are some old pokemon in the starting area of Sun/Moon, but not that much and they are in different forms. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you hack your 2/3DS you will be able to play it online. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres the Monster Hunter series that is DaS like in difficulty, lots of grinding to get materials to make better armor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im good looking and /fit/, so I can do whatever I want. #$%
@#$ $#@ That should have been a thing from the start. #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking never used my 3D function, as it sucked ass and was disorienting as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is hacking the 2/3DS separate to getting the R4 type card? #$%
@#$ $#@ I see someone selling a homebrew software 2DS on a local site I was considering buying, but I didnt want it to be like locked out of online play or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Trails of Cold Steel isnt anywhere close to Persona. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any similarities are skin-deep, if that. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the main reason you say its like Persona is because of the bonding events and the school, bonding events have been in since Zero no Kiseki where you played as a fucking police force. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, Cold Steel II doesnt even take place at a school. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then there's the whole orbment system which they admittedly completely fucked up in Cold Steel onward which is nothing like Persona's equipment systems. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then theres the fact that battles are on a grid, and crafts, and S-breaks... #$%
@#$ $#@ Not me. #$%
@#$ $#@ The thing fucking sucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, by the time cfw happened I was past 3.60. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like using it but it's easy to see why some people wouldn't. #$%
@#$ $#@ My eyes are okay but even some games make my eyes hurt in 3D, namely DKC Returns and OoT 3D. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can play all of them on Vita. #$%
@#$ $#@ However, Trails in the Sky The 3rd, Zero no Kiseki aka Trails to Zero and Ao no Kiseki Trails to Azure are moonrunes only. #$%
@#$ $#@ AVOID EVO, THEY'RE REMAKES OF GAMES ALREADY ON PSP WITH WORSE MUSIC, A WORSE BATTLE SYSTEM, AND OPENING MOVIES THAT SPOIL THE FUCKING PLOTS OF THE GAMES THAT THEY'RE IN. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im pretty sure Gold and Silver run on the SGB with SGB palettes, similar to RBY. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe Im remembering wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Meant to post the handheld port. #$%
@#$ $#@ I totally missed the bandwagon on this one. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least you posted best girl. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually, the PSP is a great PS1 for most games. #$%
@#$ $#@ But that device looks interesting too! #$%
@#$ $#@ You know, I never really noticed a difference between UMD load times and memory stick. #$%
@#$ $#@ But then Im using a 1001. #$%
@#$ $#@ So do you have one or just want one? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd warn against buying a device specifically for pc game streaming-- I was hyped as hell about that feature on my Shield tablet and found that there's always just a tiny bit of input delay that soured me to the experience after a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ And some games can be divas about connecting to a device. #$%
@#$ $#@ are you me? #$%
@#$ $#@ cept im 23 and yugioh instead of pokemon #$%
@#$ $#@ Specifically 20 year olds, but nice story. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got a lot of hand me downs from my brothers when I was a kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am 21 and my parents had money but didnt spend it on stupid shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ They opted for a four bedroom house in the suburbs instead, so I got a snes hand me down and I played that until I got a N64. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had a lot of time with a link to the past so I grew up on the snes and N64 mostly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I am 21 years old almost 22. #$%
@#$ $#@ 20yos wouldnt even know what a discman was. #$%
@#$ $#@ That shit is from the 90s faggot. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2000+ was mp3 players #$%
@#$ $#@ The Discman was still quite popular in 2000-2004. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mp3 players didn't surpass them in sales until 2004 #$%
@#$ $#@ Eva a qt #$%
@#$ $#@ You monster #$%
@#$ $#@ PC, probobly because from eastern europe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop whining #$%
@#$ $#@ N64/Xbox OG #$%
@#$ $#@ Best console out there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Happy birthday anon #$%
@#$ $#@ thx my dude #$%
@#$ $#@ Why must you be so cruel to remind me? #$%
@#$ $#@ And then you fuck his widow. #$%
@#$ $#@ still upsets me #$%
@#$ $#@ aw i didnt need this feel today. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jun is still alive. #$%
@#$ $#@ you picked the wrong ending faggot, always save the girl, doubly so for cute lesbians #$%
@#$ $#@ I was told its all mine by a friend but I just couldnt save it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, why was it the general? #$%
@#$ $#@ It does, but at the same time they both were also saved. #$%
@#$ $#@ The mc takes one antizin out of the crate he burns and never uses it the entire game #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like they have much else to do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who said they were suprised, genius? #$%
@#$ $#@ Money is the logic. #$%
@#$ $#@ My favourite DLC plothole is that the whole thing started with them not being able to get out of Harran but then you do the fucking sidequest to escort the country girl into Old Town through a tunnel. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you wanna play Suikoden 2 don't open pic #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean Ill be honest I thought the entire point of the DLC was going to be clearing up the plot hole that Crane still has a fucking vial of special cure juice in his pocket. #$%
@#$ $#@ But no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mandatory Despair. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like to imagine his wreckless use of parkour results in him slamming it against a wall and shattering it #$%
@#$ $#@ Not with Plot Armor™ #$%
@#$ $#@ The story sucked dick, but my god was the music on point in that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ The John Carpenter vibes were palpable. #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt he basically lex luther now #$%
@#$ $#@ The black kids from the Last of US #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck happened to her at the end of 2? #$%
@#$ $#@ I had one in high school. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was killed by a drunk driver a wigger in a riced-out honda. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been emotionally stunted ever since. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jackie Estacado don't need no dead waifu, I got snakes #$%
@#$ $#@ She turned into some kind of winged demon in my ending #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't save it from Blizzard's greed, and getting killed in D3 in a shitty low-budget cutscene like a second-rate third worlder NPC written by absolute retards that completely failed to understand what Diablo is about. #$%
@#$ $#@ I refuse to believe D3 is canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering that there wont be a D4, this feels entirely fair. #$%
@#$ $#@ First loves are the hardest man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let him reflect #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, man #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for reminding asshole #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent played fable is yeeeaaars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that your mother or your sister? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was ready to let slip the dogs of war to avenge him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then when the whole reveal about him being the guy walking you around happened, I fucking hated him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seriously, Loader Bot is a cunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ My man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Absolutely fantastic soundtrack. #$%
@#$ $#@ First one needs to get ported to PC, more people need to know about these games #$%
@#$ $#@ --DELETED BY ADMIN-- #$%
@#$ $#@ After Okumuras death - yes, JUST is the word I would use to describe their situation. #$%
@#$ $#@ prolly a publicity stunt. #$%
@#$ $#@ gtfo with that s*** LOL #$%
@#$ $#@ Rifle looks cooler, has a cooler reload, takes less space, has higher maximum firepower, basically why would you ever use semi-auto? #$%
@#$ $#@ Because if you use the rifle on standard ennemies the extra fire power is pointless and if you use it on something that requires multiples shots then the semi-auto has higher DPS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre really supposed to use the high capacity low fire power weapons to trigger melee comboes on weak enemies. #$%
@#$ $#@ So yeah, Id say it has some use. #$%
@#$ $#@ Other applications besides being the most efficient weapon in the game you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, cant think of one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Conserving ammo for other stuff when you dont feel like knifing to do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats actually a clip anon #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wanted to sound like a /k/ autist #$%
@#$ $#@ /k/ autists know the difference between a clip and a magazine #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why I said sound not am one. #$%
@#$ $#@ On Pro mode, its the best weapon right after the knife. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have yet to do a run without the TMP #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you sell it when you have so much ammo for it? #$%
@#$ $#@ What mod is this? #$%
@#$ $#@ the opposite of a mod #$%
@#$ $#@ What do you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ A dom. #$%
@#$ $#@ A DOM? #$%
@#$ $#@ mine thrower #$%
@#$ $#@ he's satiring the fedora, watch it through #$%
@#$ $#@ very funny dickface harhar but if you don't watch 8T you clearly don't know it's all satire #$%
@#$ $#@ Copy pasting or pastebinning sites like Kotaku or Polygon is a bannable offense now #$%
@#$ $#@ I will literally never click on a link to Polygon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, guess what faggot, as much as i hate devs shoving token black people, fags and woman everywhere to pander to tumblr, i hate when /pol/ goes full retarded about any game release, just like a tumblrite landwhale #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you just post this shit at random now? #$%
@#$ $#@ WHITE POWAH! #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, you're such a smart centrist : #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you cuck #$%
@#$ $#@ Why should i take a side in a war between 2 autistic groups throwing shit and piss on each other? #$%
@#$ $#@ Americunts are pathetic actually. #$%
@#$ $#@ All they can do is make these trigger happy warmongering and infinite diversitymongering games, both are an utter plague for society. #$%
@#$ $#@ Amerifats are retarded in all senses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because it triggers /v/ as much as a white protagonist triggers tumblr #$%
@#$ $#@ hey when you're right you can't go wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why are you even here? #$%
@#$ $#@ You should ignore it rather than bumping the thread #$%
@#$ $#@ Friendly reminder that you can play as the nazis in multiplayer #$%
@#$ $#@ That army vet can tie me to a tree and shoot me fives times a close range any time. #$%
@#$ $#@ This will not be answered in any of the threads leading up to the game's release #$%
@#$ $#@ HOW MANY FUCKING THREADS ARE WE GOING TO HAVE ABOUT THIS ONE SHITTY ARTICLE FUCK #$%
@#$ $#@ A lot, spamming the link, looking for page views. #$%
@#$ $#@ ad revenue. #$%

@#$ $#@ Ignoring the fact that no one would have probably ever said ad mortem to someone they were trying to cut down, its still grammatically correct. #$%
@#$ $#@ "Inimicus" however is flat out wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ It should be "inimice." #$%

@#$ $#@ Christian Woman, fawk yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats her name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wanna suck the blood out of my penis suse? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats to know? #$%
@#$ $#@ Everything about her is external. #$%
@#$ $#@ vampires cant and dont have sex in wod #$%
@#$ $#@ stay mad bitch nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ I prefer the purple dildo from dark souls 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's from softs' calling card essentially. #$%
@#$ $#@ Moonlight blade was also in their armored core games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was usually one of the most powerful energy blades you could get. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had high energy consumption and weight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Assblasted Forest Invader #$%
@#$ $#@ The Moonlight Vortex has pretty OP damage and range. #$%
@#$ $#@ It catches people off guard. #$%
@#$ $#@ and king's field #$%
@#$ $#@ I love this webm. #$%
@#$ $#@ Great now I want to try that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like a fun combo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chikage is top tier for fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Killing everything in 2 hits is great. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just have to hope it hits, assuming From didn't adjust it somehow to not whiff harmlessly into the ground half the time #$%
@#$ $#@ Moonlight Butterfly Horn was so underrated. #$%
@#$ $#@ That shit was fucking choice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Awful taste minus Demons Souls. #$%
@#$ $#@ demon souls looks horrible #$%
@#$ $#@ Its pretty fun but the shield does jack for you defense wise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody sees the beam coming though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jokes on you, I use Old Moonlight #$%
@#$ $#@ raw astora longsword, enjoy r1 mashing until youre high enough to make miracles viable #$%
@#$ $#@ raw ass is dead, raw broadsword is the new meme #$%
@#$ $#@ It doesn't look like a popsicle in Bloodborne though, or Demon's Souls for that matter. #$%
@#$ $#@ It did, but you had to meet certain stat requirements before you could shoot the beam, if I remember right. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had a Bluemoon build in DaS2, does that count? #$%
@#$ $#@ the original is pretty dope, even if the hilt's shape is a tad unusual #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually there is a real fruit that was the original base for the flavor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the white bark raspberry, the name blue raspberry comes from the really dark coloration of the fruit that gives it an almost blue-black color sometimes. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember watching a pvp video where the player spammed the flying kick into that one dark firestorm spell. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looked pretty effective. #$%
@#$ $#@ this is like getting mad at people who use ultima in final fantasy games #$%
@#$ $#@ It would be if the flying kick worked on people who haven't received lobotomies #$%
@#$ $#@ Clerics starting mace is both fun and good. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like getting it early but fuck I hate killing him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes such a nice dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with it #$%
@#$ $#@ clearly it's sea salt icecream #$%
@#$ $#@ That is some great editing #$%
@#$ $#@ what was he doing inside that memory #$%
@#$ $#@ not at all #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey Guts #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Ive only ever used the claymore, mace, dagger, and silver knight spear across all of my characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love simple sword designs, why are they just so elegant? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just a signature by From Software. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its in every single one of their games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Armored Core. #$%
@#$ $#@ how do I build for HMS asides from korean gem farming? #$%
@#$ $#@ Last time I read about it in /bbg/, you need to be 110+ to be viable with it for stat allocation #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats my main problem with DS3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every weapon seems to have some crazy attack. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like that they added more variety, but I really liked how in DS1 there were mostly just completely mundane weapons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not only because its cool taking on monsters with just a sharpened bar of steel, but it also made those special weapons stand out more. #$%
@#$ $#@ Xbox 1 version. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got to new game plus 5 by using the magic mace on the ledge in das2 before scholarship, now it's hard to find and is still best weapon in the game imo, I literally used that weapon only #$%
@#$ $#@ literally just started using it in darks souls 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ fucking awesome weapon #$%
@#$ $#@ Today I learned how to say "Dark Souls 3 is my first From game" in Brazillian #$%
@#$ $#@ Best Moonlight sword is in DS2 and i dont even like the game.It has such powerful looking special attacks #$%
@#$ $#@ What armor is that in that last bit?I dont think i've seen it before #$%
@#$ $#@ Burial Knight set. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its cut content, sadly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ These were DSi games, werent they? #$%
@#$ $#@ don't forget the best boy #$%
@#$ $#@ bitch boy! #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a permanent party member so she doesn't count #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres no queen in shogi. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're the first other guy I've seen who likes Ohya. #$%
@#$ $#@ What would her thief aesthetic be? #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt she said everytime ahe plays she feels like a queen commanding an army? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or am i stupei? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes fun, probably the best adult character in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shed use spears and tanegashima/arquebus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her ultimate persona #$%
@#$ $#@ Does Yusuke count as a ninja already? #$%
@#$ $#@ What would her mask be like? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think i'm going to download the japanese pack, i seriously can't unhear yukiko with her #$%
@#$ $#@ an Oni mask #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but I thought she just said Commander, could be wrong about that though #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats wrong with that, anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything else would be a crime. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're right, but Haru didn't need to be a party member to be useful to the plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Her dad was supposed to be a case that the thieves felt very little attachment to anyway and only went along with because the public demanded it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had she not been a party member and forgiven them all immediately it would have made the guilt from their fallout that much more intense. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing that'd be missing is they'd need some other way through the biometric scanner. #$%
@#$ $#@ But that could just as easily not exist or Futaba could whip something up. #$%
@#$ $#@ As it is now shes sidelined by the plot almost immediately. #$%
@#$ $#@ This would matter more if you could actually wingman your bros to the available female party members. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, just think how a dialogue between Yusuke and Hifumi would be #$%
@#$ $#@ shogun is a more apt title #$%
@#$ $#@ you mean, these? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah fuck me #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes boring as fuck mate. #$%
@#$ $#@ She has the weakest confidant in the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto should have been Rider fuck you #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck, that's fucking great #$%
@#$ $#@ very nice #$%
@#$ $#@ Military uniform with a cape, Oni mask , wields a Naginata and her gun is a Sniper Rifle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Codename is Commander because General is hard for Japanese people to pronounce #$%
@#$ $#@ The codenames are all Western so shed probably just be Queen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yusuke can already use Japanese-style muskets so its kinda overlapping. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, the Sniper Rifle just adds some cool contrast. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man, every black person should become a weeaboo, niggaboos are the best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy fuck, saved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe thats how we battle inner city crime. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not by education, but by anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ holy shit, give her a cape please #$%
@#$ $#@ The only thing I remember is that she likes shogi. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Ohya had more shit going for her #$%
@#$ $#@ No and neither does Makoto for some odd reason #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally i would make her -kunda focused, like Akihiko #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I love science #$%
@#$ $#@ Kunda + bless spells #$%
@#$ $#@ am I the second? #$%
@#$ $#@ anon pls #$%
@#$ $#@ well we got this #$%
@#$ $#@ If spears, why not codename "Lance" to go with the shogi theme? #$%
@#$ $#@ wait, how does hifumi get to hawaii? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think Im on Rank 7 and at the point where you need max knowledge for her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Towards the end of the trip, you get messages from people, depending on your relationship with them, to hang out on the last night before leaving. #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto texted me despite only being Rank 5 and Hifumi was in Hawaii too since Yusukes school had to divert over. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here, wanted to go for sensei, but Hifumi took me by surprise and now she's waifu for laifu #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope you know how to play shogi with her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Many hours of Yakuza have prepared me for this day. #$%
@#$ $#@ may sound silly but a game where all the party members are persona villains would be sick as hell #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats only half of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if it's a loli #$%
@#$ $#@ and it should be Sojiro #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldn't even finish V #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't fight retards #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck, I was about to reference the same god damn thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of those questions and answers were mazing. #$%
@#$ $#@ IN WHAT YEAR DID THE BATTLE OF HAMSTRINGS TAKE PLACE? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that the guy who called a guy a nigger at the laugh factory ? #$%
@#$ $#@ Earthworm jim #$%
@#$ $#@ what kind of game is that? #$%
@#$ $#@ VN mostly with some gameplay like a first person dungeon crawler where you go place A to B and a few puzzles here and there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only difference from a normal VN is that it doesn't use a static image with the characters, instead has moving pictures/reactions changing all the time, CG and FMV throw in mixed with dialogs of course so it doesn't get stale. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also it's by Suda51 before "lol wacky shit" so it's a somewhat serious VN about a crime unit trying to capture a serial killer but of course shit goes down and "deep the rabbit hole" than you except. #$%
@#$ $#@ It can get confusing by the last part bt I really enjoyed and can't wait for TSC: Ward 25 #$%
@#$ $#@ expect* fuck my bad #$%
@#$ $#@ sounds legit, ll check it out, thanks #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that Kraimer from seinfeld? #$%
@#$ $#@ 9 times out of 10 it's the median answer #$%
@#$ $#@ I hate that in Fallout NV #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt really expecting a remake but more-so a enhanced port, this sounds like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ But who was flag Goomba? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fake and gay #$%
@#$ $#@ That nigger has leaked a lot of legit shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldn't say it's fake tbqh #$%
@#$ $#@ You are fake news #$%
@#$ $#@ Er, shit, its ~550. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fake and gay #$%
@#$ $#@ remake with added minigame #$%
@#$ $#@ Where did you see the size? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah thats pretty reassuring, sounds like it could be a remake after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ He leaked in yours're mum's butt, if you catch my drift xD #$%
@#$ $#@ It was in the metadata queries that I was using to leak info, same as the product code CTR-P-BRME. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats the lol for, he did leak things from sun and moon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fake and gay. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fraudulent and homosexual. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why don't you suqq on my beef missle #$%
@#$ $#@ *kisses u* :3c #$%
@#$ $#@ ITS RUINED! #$%
@#$ $#@ THEY RUINED IT! #$%
@#$ $#@ The original is great, the rest are varying levels of bleh #$%
@#$ $#@ Bowser's Inside story is pretty damned good #$%
@#$ $#@ Superstar saga is good. #$%
@#$ $#@ super mario rpg, paper mario, and mario &amp; luigi superstar saga are the good mario rpgs #$%
@#$ $#@ Why did you hate it so much? #$%
@#$ $#@ There is nothing that bad near the end of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you, Jesus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not him, but barafagging and ignoring BIS issues like /v/ loves doing aside, DT is twice as long so I can sorta understand that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Requesting CJ following the damn train #$%
@#$ $#@ Motivation to give a fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rion from Galerians #$%
@#$ $#@ Alright, what should I do with him? #$%
@#$ $#@ Just think of it as a way to improve #$%
@#$ $#@ Draw him stumbling around blindly because he tied a normal blindfold over his eyes instead of a visor #$%
@#$ $#@ yes I just want to do paid commissions some day so I am doing requests right now #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone did that for me here a while ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just saiyan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, I'll give it a go #$%
@#$ $#@ can u draw shrek as an endgame boss? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the difference between us and you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I draw because I like to draw, its like playing vidya. #$%
@#$ $#@ Posting here or on my blog it doesnt matter, even if I had nowhere to post, I would keep drawing. #$%
@#$ $#@ This was already done twice, don't be greedy #$%
@#$ $#@ Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 #$%
@#$ $#@ if you post on any blog you are partly doing it for the attention, otherwise you wouldn't really need to post if it weren't for financial reasons #$%
@#$ $#@ Then draw it yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats probably true. #$%
@#$ $#@ But the main reason I post it, it's because I like drawing, otherwise I wouldn't bother. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did draw way before I had nowhere to post, just kept for myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ My artwork, along with the rest of my life, is mediocre and unfulfilling. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also no gf #$%
@#$ $#@ Because the average person thinks drawing is magic, you are born with drawing skill instead of working for it, and it takes 5 minutes to create masterpieces, therefore the best work is worth $20, if that. #$%
@#$ $#@ procrastination and failing school #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant wait for the day this anon finally gets his fucking request done. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about Tia from Potion Maker in one? #$%

@#$ $#@ eh, as far as I can tell, they don't usually tell you, so then they don't HAVE to, you know? #$%

@#$ $#@ Finals and shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ i believe it's just the breast outlines are too thicc where there isn't as much as a big bump on the sides #$%
@#$ $#@ I need to do that, yea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im too lazy to mess around with the brush settings. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want to see some lewd of Tsubaki. #$%

@#$ $#@ Whats with all the new users here today? #$%
@#$ $#@ Delivering to yourself just doesn't give you the same feeling #$%
@#$ $#@ That's a nice way to get around the fact that you're a total failure with zero current skills and no plans to obtaining any. #$%
@#$ $#@ draw for others then #$%
@#$ $#@ Because surprise, people have work, family and other shits to take care of and even more of a surprise, drawing take a lot of times to be good at. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off newfag #$%

@#$ $#@ The artist deleted that picture, didnt he? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even the artist himself may not want you to post that #$%
@#$ $#@ I never said anything about it because it was deleted by the time I got back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Artist seemed to not like it so nothing I can do about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Revisionist historian you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was deleted by the artist, this would be a different story if that was not the case. #$%
@#$ $#@ The artist doesn't want it posted after second thought and I won't think much of it as to respect that. #$%
@#$ $#@ not him, but I don't think I posted in the /trash/ drawthread today #$%
@#$ $#@ eh cmon now, dont reject this. #$%
@#$ $#@ give some support to people who try to do something beneficial #$%
@#$ $#@ No, you dont understand, hes not rejecting it, hes respecting the artists wishes by telling him its shit and pretending it never existed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking Makotofag. #$%

@#$ $#@ Unfortunately some people are just here for free commissions. #$%
@#$ $#@ You don't really need to adjust much beside the size, opacity adjustment is for after finish lining and start coloring, you decrease the opacity of the lining layer down a little so the line doesn't pop more then the color. #$%

@#$ $#@ How is it rude, he didnt delete it, the artist did. #$%
@#$ $#@ He didnt want it posted anymore. #$%
@#$ $#@ The artist tried his best and realized it was bad and deleted. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are trying to cry over somebody who does not deserve the tears. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't really draw chibi #$%
@#$ $#@ i think he deleted it because he got bullied. #$%
@#$ $#@ even worse when the requester agreed that its bad and never said his thanks and keep reposting out of disrespect and preference for better deliveries. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds hot, what character? #$%
@#$ $#@ which one of you is the original requester? #$%
@#$ $#@ now that youve seen thee delivery, say your thanks and cherish the delivery and never post it again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looking through the archive, I didnt even post the request in that thread. #$%
@#$ $#@ How the fuck are you revising history to the point where I already posted the request in that thread and said it was shit? #$%
@#$ $#@ *never post the request again. #$%
@#$ $#@ At this point, I am pissed enough so just kiss my ass and I fuck that entire notion. #$%
@#$ $#@ How are you backing the artist when he himself deleted the picture. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are doing the opposite and have no shame. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got the reference and it was funny as hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless it was deleted for being shitty, he deleted it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look at the comments replied to it and you tell me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its for getting newfags like you to lurk more. #$%
@#$ $#@ So what youre saying is that you cant and youre just interpreting it in whatever way lets you justify rerequesting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats cute, thanks! #$%

@#$ $#@ Are westerns whos better #$%
@#$ $#@ What about 2whos #$%
@#$ $#@ Braixen are 87.5 percent male, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasn't expecting any interest but I'm glad there was, this turned out great. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love the angle and expression she has, thanks a lot drawfriend. #$%
@#$ $#@ I appreciate that you included the full suggestion too! #$%
@#$ $#@ That fivehead though #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, thats my bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ still working on getting heads to look right with their faces #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to bully that cute bulge #$%
@#$ $#@ Good luck anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hifumi taking a thick cock in her ass at a gloryhole. #$%
@#$ $#@ UNF THIS! #$%
@#$ $#@ Ass to ass with a thick double dildo. #$%
@#$ $#@ What an asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's one stupid-looking cat #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop pretending traps arent gay. #$%
@#$ $#@ This makes me super butthurt that our culture is so inferior that this wouldve ended with a passionate makeout session. #$%
@#$ $#@ pathfinders internally #$%
@#$ $#@ Asians dont give a fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you read the file name? #$%
@#$ $#@ there is an italian ad which is the exact opposite of that #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats insanely creative. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats a bird ding dong #$%
@#$ $#@ you gotta have a really tall room in order to even pull what this guy did if you think about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lel, this reminds me of some really old eastern europe one, where negro kid turns into slav after he goes to bath. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn and they say white men cant jump #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck is going on here #$%
@#$ $#@ Birds in a grain silo, I think. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looks like a sand or grain silo either being emptied or with a collapsed air pocket. #$%
@#$ $#@ The flying rats are too stupid to move away from the shifting material and are pulled it. #$%
@#$ $#@ A good kick in the ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ How about belief? #$%
@#$ $#@ social media propoganda #$%
@#$ $#@ Lie: A beautiful woman, Ravel. #$%
@#$ $#@ As you changed me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't get the Genji skin/DVA highlight intro which I would've liked. #$%
@#$ $#@ yes get it now #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent played since the Olympics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doing my part and proudly contributing to the 30 million people who have at some point in their lives touched Overwatch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Says May 1st. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is my first event with OW, dunno if they stop the event at exactly May 2nd 12AM on their time or exactly May 1st 12AM. #$%
@#$ $#@ Saved up for the mcree skin then got it as a duplicate on the next box. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why not buy it with coins? #$%
@#$ $#@ I spend them immediately. #$%
@#$ $#@ I buy all the shitty items to increase my drop rate for legendaries, and it basically worked the entire event because I grinded all the legendary skins fairly easily. #$%
@#$ $#@ Meis just never dropped. #$%
@#$ $#@ discussing this shit should be bannable #$%
@#$ $#@ May 1st is the last day officially, but if it goes the same as the last two events, itll actually end when they normally do patches - which is Tuesday morning. #$%
@#$ $#@ No it doesnt work. #$%
@#$ $#@ That guy is stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ servers are hosted in the USofA we're not in a fascist country #$%
@#$ $#@ Thatll teach you not to buy cheap shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dunno, I had used the same motherboard +6 years or so #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont we have to wait another 4 years? #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant be assed to dig up the post where Kaplan confirmed it, but Overwatch Summer Games is yearly. #$%
@#$ $#@ Overwatch Summer games are going to be every year. #$%
@#$ $#@ i bought like 10 boxes a few minutes ago and got the 2 skins i wanted because i still hadnt got them yet and i didnt want to miss out i mean, it was only 10 bucks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beardless torb, Mercy, Bastion, and thats it. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh my god what's wrong with their faces #$%
@#$ $#@ go find a sugar daddy you slut. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got all except traced and mercy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never got any dupes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had to buy the genji skin though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also got almost all the emotes too. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's legit autism #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive gotten the McCree skin 4 times along with a few non-even legendaries. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can go fuck yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a Zarya main. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I wanted was McCree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got Bastion, Orisa, Torb, and Tracer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know that feel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Got Orisa, Mercy, and Rein. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have like 20 minutes on Mercy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Feels bad but at least she a qt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even get the things I wanted Mcree skin + DVA highlight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Event grinding for disappointing RNG is wearing thin on me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive started spending more and more time on Titanfall 2 instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're a fucking nigger you know that #$%
@#$ $#@ I know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel dirty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ended up having to buy McCrees skin because after 22 bought boxes and thirty or so earned boxes I got every other skin but Tracer, McCree, Rein and the shitty Torb one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tracer skin is boring as fuck, go for Widow. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mercy looks so much better with her hair down #$%
@#$ $#@ Tracers ass looks amazing in her event skin. #$%
@#$ $#@ The HotS challenge begins as soon as Uprising ends; so in about 12 odd hours. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a seasonal thing; it'll be back next year. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't get why they don't just keep it permanently #$%
@#$ $#@ the pve game mode is pretty fun, feels satisfying shooting bots #$%
@#$ $#@ Gotta drive lootbox sales :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ i already did #$%
@#$ $#@ i want widow to kick my ass #$%
@#$ $#@ You already know I did #$%
@#$ $#@ no you fucking dont, unless you are an autist who looks at his own plays/vids. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only time you actually see them if you are using an emote waiting for the game to start or when you die, and then who gives a fuck #$%
@#$ $#@ overwatch is a popular game that other devs are going to follow it's example, yeah it actually matters #$%
@#$ $#@ But I dont play this hero, ever. #$%
@#$ $#@ Confirmed theyll be put in the lootboxes soon tm #$%
@#$ $#@ Tough decision between orisas, mccree and genji skins, at the I was fuck genji and people who play him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japs are weird. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its desperate attempt to give character but it just completely fails because there is no actual character and the shitty attempts at being smug and edgy all fall flat because there is no character or personality to back up those things to begin with. #$%
@#$ $#@ That specific scene only comes up if you choose not to kill him and accept his offer though #$%
@#$ $#@ Its justified in my game since he started building bombs in class. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's hard as fuck by jap standards #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, he is as evil as they come. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes an adrenaline junkie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only possible explanation for how he acts. #$%
@#$ $#@ you forget the average lanky japanese boy is a non confrontational beta bitch boy who needs to stay out of trouble and keep good grades as to not dishonor famiry #$%
@#$ $#@ The Phantom Thieves are famous and the world seemed normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did he just pile on the work to them and get off scot free? #$%
@#$ $#@ thats like saying you got spoiled for the final boss of a super mario game #$%
@#$ $#@ You've been fighting a world-ending god since P2 EP #$%
@#$ $#@ I havent played P2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nor P4. #$%
@#$ $#@ He has a few lines here and there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly just reactions. #$%
@#$ $#@ what was the point of this ending? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes basically saying you think 2+2=5, youre still wrong even though you think its right. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Milentia hasn't gone back to Majula yet, buy all of her lifegems, and the blacksmith's key. #$%
@#$ $#@ When she moves to Majula, shell give you the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring which gives you more souls per kill. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, no. #$%
@#$ $#@ When the game literally throws 8 enemies at you and you cant kite because youre on a blocked off platform, its bullshit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been dealing with it so far, but unless the game gives you some AOE spells or abilities I don't see how the fuck a mage is supposed to clear some areas on the first try. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, its a RPG, the point is to level up you fucking retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you rushing past enemies and not expecting them to become aggressive towards you or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for proving you fell for /v/ meme you complete retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ The best way to farm souls in DS2 early game is to put your summon sign down on the bridge for the run up to the chariot and rider boss in Huntsmans Copse. #$%
@#$ $#@ it soothes nerves #$%
@#$ $#@ To add to this, if you have at least 14 INT, there's an NPC phantom you can kill about midway through Huntsman's Copse that has a chance to drop a Warlock Mask that increases INT and souls you get slightly. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can also get it guaranteed from a petrified Lion Warrior in the Shaded Ruins, but that costs a Fragrant Branch. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bloodborne is even better for blowing off steam #$%
@#$ $#@ You lack the necessary skills to manage and mitigate challenge in this game and when called out on it you react with hostility. #$%
@#$ $#@ No I dont. #$%
@#$ $#@ SoTFS is one of my all time favorite games. #$%
@#$ $#@ it kinda sux that it wasnt a free update and that the jewd us out but i didnt have any of the dlc so it was still not a complete waste for me #$%
@#$ $#@ Because they identify with all of those points #$%
@#$ $#@ I enjoyed the game, I'm glad I'm not an autistic sperg who gives a shit about politics in vidya #$%
@#$ $#@ The story is bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also what this dude said. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK ROTTEN ADULTS #$%
@#$ $#@ Is there a single game or other piece of media that doesnt trigger /pol/ babies in some way? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut your whore mouth Bae and choose. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Angus and Gregg were the least offensive gay characters Ive seen in a game since they were characters first and gay second. #$%
@#$ $#@ Give me an example of one non-teenage character talking that way #$%
@#$ $#@ I would have if she wasn't the main character #$%
@#$ $#@ the janitor/maintenance bird #$%
@#$ $#@ gregg and angus are. #$%
@#$ $#@ mae seems to be pansexual or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off back to /pol/ #$%
@#$ $#@ JRPGs are exactly the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tap A to continue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does something really need to go back to a storyboard if its massively successful and beloved by everyone except sad contrarians? #$%
@#$ $#@ You know if I got shot in the fucking knee by a bolt I don't think I'd be watching my mouth #$%
@#$ $#@ Anyone in their 20s who a has no clue what they wanna do with their lives and b ever had friends. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's like your opinion man #$%
@#$ $#@ She wants to fuck some girl at a nightclub while going out with Bea. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also wants to fuck guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh wow what a big difference, getting shot in the arm is a LOT less worse! #$%
@#$ $#@ Of all of the valid things to criticize the game for this is particularly retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im shocked that there are a large majority of people still in that faze. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like they never moved on. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well at any rate they say 'eff because if they said Fuck they'd get an M rating when they were shooting for a T rating. #$%
@#$ $#@ to be fair, they're very liberal with shit and damn, but fuck is a big no-no that they're too afraid to touch #$%
@#$ $#@ Again, because Fuck bumps your game up to M rating. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is less of a theyre retarded thing and more of a the ESRB is retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gotta disagree, all three of the main Angus is like half a main character, given hes a tagalong dude for most everything not someone you can actually hang out with except once characters are developed pretty well as believable people. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sad 35 year olds craving for their 20s they never lived, like the author. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be that guy, /v/, there's still time. #$%
@#$ $#@ you sound like an underage trying to fit in #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im a sad 30 year who DID live that exact life in my 20s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone is a shallow insufferable douchebag around that time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heck, youre on /v/ being a contrarian whining about tumblr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Odds are youre pretty insufferable yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thats okay. #$%
@#$ $#@ The artist/writer is an equally big faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, the Artist co-wrote. #$%
@#$ $#@ Vague references to a Matewan style event and a statue of a guy who hated unions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Apart from that the politics really werent that commie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why should I give a shit about the developer though? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought Lori was a boy... #$%
@#$ $#@ You shouldnt, but his complaint about the writing hits pretty spot on. #$%
@#$ $#@ They always say that #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not just /v/ unfortunately, a lot of people stupidly believe that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, but in this case I believe it was quite genuine, given after finding out about furry porn, they removed as many references to species and animals as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Originally the characters were supposed to comment on the various animal types and such. #$%
@#$ $#@ Lots of cut dialogue still in the game code. #$%
@#$ $#@ What a load of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was always curious to me that they were animals but there was absolutely no mention of it anywhere. #$%
@#$ $#@ The closest anyone came to having an animal trait was Mae scratching that mirror with her claw in Greggs path. #$%
@#$ $#@ I honestly would have just rolled with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Furries like this game no matter what. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ironic, considering this whole thing was a desperate cry for something they didnt experience. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre not wrong about amerifat being manchildren way into their late 20s though, it just sticks out because they have no real knowledge about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like how liminial she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Adults call her a kid because she is immature, and the teenagers reject her for being too old. #$%
@#$ $#@ The old dude, Mr. #$%
@#$ $#@ Penderson, was supposed to complain about you climbers! #$%
@#$ $#@ You mice and cats always running over roof tops and powerlines! #$%
@#$ $#@ Outta put a tax on you! #$%
@#$ $#@ or something to that effect on the second day I believe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who is "they" here? #$%
@#$ $#@ this, people don't seem to understand that Mae and Gregg are complete fuck-ups and certain characters in-universe acknowledge and despise them because of it #$%
@#$ $#@ The team behind it. #$%
@#$ $#@ So theyre just retarded then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or she might be 15, I dunno, I just check her tumblr for cute art every now and again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cause her stuff is fockin adorable #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ infused the politics heavily into this game as an excuse to have /pol/ threads. #$%
@#$ $#@ dang whats this all about #$%
@#$ $#@ A 20 year old virgin who still almost got laid at a party only to fuck up everything three seconds later and have to leave the party to find her friend she accidentally caused to have a nervous breakdown because shes an immaculate fuckup. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just looked it up, pretty neat. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can kinda see Germ's plot wasn't really polished in the writing, and I can see why it was kinda cut with grandma forshadowing being so blunt on everything major to the plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really damn shame though because you needed more just little hang outs with people like Germ and Angus. #$%
@#$ $#@ The dude also made this and one for Germ. #$%
@#$ $#@ His I dont give a shit about politics in vidya statement reeks of the kind of people you see today that are not on the extreme left or right and feel so much more intelligent than everyone else because of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt hes apolitical. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just the kind of cunt who "enjoys the games for what they are" and won't stfu about it #$%
@#$ $#@ I like this one the most. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow Germ looking away into the circle against the black makes it really moody. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really wish theyd done more with Dad as a character. #$%
@#$ $#@ They didnt really give him much of a personality IMO. #$%
@#$ $#@ The tooth scene at the very end is the most he really gets, no hangouts or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then again Ive only played the game twice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mightve missed something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh huh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sure you did. #$%
@#$ $#@ With low attention because otherwise you wouldnt be making sweeping generalizations. #$%
@#$ $#@ On a tangibly related note, Prequel Update Soon Tee Emm fellow anons. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a side story up now that's another one of those "unlocks a paragraph a day" think Kaz is so fond of "to keep us entertained" while he finishes the Katia update which is apparently gonna be somewhat hefty and was supposed to come out today but something something assets. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont feel like I can pin any of that on Mae, hard as I try. #$%
@#$ $#@ She made fun of that guys major like I assume Bea and her do from their sarcastic comments in the mall, but that was kinda it for that. #$%
@#$ $#@ The rest of what she did was accidentally let it slip that they were from Possum Springs and not students and that Bea worked at a hardware store she practically owned. #$%
@#$ $#@ He gets a few hints at what kind of person he is, but yeah, underdeveloped. #$%
@#$ $#@ He was apparently an alcoholic and stopped drinking "because he was dangerous to me and my mom" as said by a drunken Mae. #$%
@#$ $#@ He hates his job at the deli because even though it's a lot easier than being a miner "they at least respected you as a worker [in the mines]," and he's overall a pretty chill dude who loves his daughter. #$%
@#$ $#@ I loved watching TV with him just because it was cute to see them together like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its Catcher in the Rye. #$%
@#$ $#@ Who the fuck hates Zootopia? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do it faget #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a static IP so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4chan has been flooded by normies for almost an entire decade now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its inevitable some of them would be surprised at seeing dogdicks and bird tits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also Greg putting cups on his ears. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a typo nigger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus Im typing from my phone. #$%
@#$ $#@ dumb phoneposter #$%
@#$ $#@ Ok, making fun of that guy was Mae being horrible at socializing, Ill admit that. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was just following Bea's example from the side of Bea she didn't know she was hiding. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen pretty well adjusted people make similar mistakes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell, people who made that specifically to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ But fault does lie with her there. #$%
@#$ $#@ The main crux of what made Bea run off like she did was just Mae accidentally telling them who Bea really was, and thats without a doubt Bea at fault. #$%
@#$ $#@ The really should of made a fetish game instead of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would of done way better in terms of sales. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, it apparently sold better than they expected it to. #$%
@#$ $#@ turn on that drag-based typing thing if you haven't, it's way faster and more accurate. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a Jojo reference? #$%
@#$ $#@ Not that I know of, but this is. #$%
@#$ $#@ That cat and gator belong together m8 #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you retarded or just an idiot? #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow this game is absolutely boring, even VNs offer more gameplay #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean its almost like artists use tumblr or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone drew something I don't like #$%
@#$ $#@ The only people Ive seen on here that hate it have either seen random screenshots and artwork and assume its another Undertale implying Undertale was bad, or newfags from /pol/ that hate any point of view that doesnt come from Breitbart. #$%
@#$ $#@ She looks weird with a muzzle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mae needs to be full persian. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it, I couldnt relate as much but the characters made the game enjoyable. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also bea is bae. #$%
@#$ $#@ theyre called capris, dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ And a punk wouldnt be caught dead in them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always pictured her looking more like an Abyssinian or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a matter of perspective kinda. #$%
@#$ $#@ You get out of the characters what you get, only really the cultists come off as the "wrong bad guys!". #$%
@#$ $#@ Some argue for Jackie, but I thought she was looking down on Mae from the moment she saw her and wasnt giving her a chance/trying to ditch her before she even got 2 words in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes the one with the NO FASCISTS ALLOWED line from the trailer and seems to go on pretty long political rants that Bea seems to sarcastically make fun of on her own time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Enjoy Signirsol. #$%
@#$ $#@ His stuff is a treasure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you in the wrong thread? #$%
@#$ $#@ Mae is going to die a virgin at the rate shes going. #$%
@#$ $#@ So is this gay 35 year old commie the one who did the MATRIX IS A GOOD MOVIE strawman animation? #$%
@#$ $#@ Given she bricked her computer looking up what I can only assume to be fetish porn given the popup malware, I think that while she may be a virgin, she can be described as anything but pure. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is nothing deep about and that's why every /pol/ack is on its case #$%
@#$ $#@ Shock art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats some good shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was apparently from some lets play, I dunno, I didnt care where it was from only that it was great on its own. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont worry, we can all se how new you are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im suprised so much of the art makes Mae thin. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah I would have liked the game more if it didnt do the whole cultist shtick. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean yeah, you could have kept the surreal nightmare sequences and all that shit, but it could have just been Mae having a breakdown. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just dont understand why they thought it was necessary to have entities and cultists and murder in such an otherwise down to earth and very relatable, to some anyway, story. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've not really heard anything about the fanbase, there's not much of one at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ I didn't say anything, sounds like you may be projecting a bit friendo :^ #$%
@#$ $#@ I always find 4chan freaking out at that argument in specific the most flip floppy thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre mad they sunk to your level? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're on a board that made a hero out of "stick man" #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats adorable, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good work! #$%
@#$ $#@ The ending was about not clinging to the past. #$%
@#$ $#@ That was the entire fucking point of the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant really get off to porn of characters I get really attached to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same thing happened with Undertale, for example. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just cant get into the porn of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe for some of the minor characters, but thats about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ and so this game is pro-trump? #$%
@#$ $#@ They should be accentuating her roundness. #$%
@#$ $#@ ...because western games arent aimed at depressed pedophiles? #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, cant say the game would have been better if they had stayed the course, but changing horses mid stream sure left the game with an ending that feels a bit like a gut punch. #$%
@#$ $#@ it means you disagreed with that person and they want to try and shame you into abandoning your position because it's not "mainstream" #$%
@#$ $#@ Go find them yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ nani, is this a...persona reference??! #$%
@#$ $#@ It's also on GOG, that's as close to communism as you get when it comes to vidya. #$%
@#$ $#@ VNs are video games #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre obviously not a confused teenage girl, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the same audience Life is Strange went for. #$%
@#$ $#@ Except that had waifus so /v/ was all over it. #$%
@#$ $#@ sure but the gameplay is terrible and if you don't care about stories in video games then they are a worthless genre #$%
@#$ $#@ But /v/ likes kitties too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Life is Strange was fucking shite though. #$%
@#$ $#@ NITW is what it was trying to be. #$%
@#$ $#@ NITW works better without voices, because you can imagine whatever you want for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it had VAs theres the risk of them being fucking terrible, which would kill the emotional impact the game can have. #$%
@#$ $#@ You dont need to like the characters or agree with them to enjoy a story or game. #$%
@#$ $#@ If someone only enjoys content that raises no questrions or confict in themselves, and/or further panders to an agenda they see as the only truth, its just self gratification. #$%
@#$ $#@ No they aren't you fucking weaaboo #$%
@#$ $#@ Most normal people know not to enter the thread, you can tell who the /pol/ people are. #$%
@#$ $#@ What does this post even mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you disagreeing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you disgruntled because you agree? #$%
@#$ $#@ anon is disappointed over how other anon talk about the game as if it was a painting or melody #$%
@#$ $#@ He raped her and she got pregnant. #$%
@#$ $#@ He wants to fuck her again but also wants to get rid of the baby, so hes giving her the choice of him aborting it with a bat to her stomach or hooking the baby out with a metal cloth hanger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes upset about this because women become very attached to their child even if it was made in unfortunate circumstances because instincts and biology. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes also covered in bruises, probably because he beats her as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most likely while raping her too. #$%
@#$ $#@ As for his reason I would probably guess a hate for her and a desire to prove his masculinity by forcing it on someone else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really it isn't that hard to understand unless you're child as children do not understand such adult and heavy hitting themes such as rape and abuse. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hope I helped you understand the picture that anon posted better. #$%
@#$ $#@ really makes my cogs spin #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean, I dont really enjoy spending my time talking about games I dont like, mostly because I dont play them a whole lot and I realize my knowledge of said game is probably full of gaps because of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I assume other people do the same thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Then anon is an idiot, whats the problem with analyzing games? #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the only way to figure out what works and doesn't. #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe you shouldnt have voted Trump then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Voting is stupid #$%
@#$ $#@ The term overanalizing exist for a reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ its better with sound and youtube comments #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally /pol/ lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ People are still going to enjoy it, as they evidently do. #$%
@#$ $#@ But I guess you can get mad about it too, if you really want to. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just not very helpful for anyone involved. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, thats why you call people out on their bullshit by demonstrably proving their analysis is full of shit instead of whining in a non-sequitur about college dropouts. #$%
@#$ $#@ And yet the non-sequitur about college dropouts should not be reviewed as a painting or such high artform. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its not. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neither any game in general, which is why anon posted what he did. #$%
@#$ $#@ Idetifying the goals behind design features is far from analyzing symbolism and composition techniques in paintings and the like. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuff in the game was put there for a reason, maybe a good reason or maybe a shit one, who knows, but trying to understand goals of the design is hardly pretentious or unreasonable. #$%
@#$ $#@ people who live with their parents are usually pretty fucking lazy. #$%
@#$ $#@ That says a lot more about the developer then the actual game does. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I didnt read the post original anon was quoting. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree, but the way its phrased, escpecially the quote, still makes me imagine some french dude at a museum. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id bathe with that raccoon. #$%
@#$ $#@ i'd bathe with that o?possum #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is /pol/ the first to announce their fetishes to others? #$%
@#$ $#@ Considering shes a fat anti social weirdo who everyone knows beat a kid half to death? #$%
@#$ $#@ I doubt shes that alluring, especially since it seemed pretty even gender wise at that party. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes pretty cute. #$%
@#$ $#@ The raccoon is CLEARLY cuter. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds like laziness to me anon, complete fucking apathy. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you went to a college you have resources. #$%
@#$ $#@ so, /vpol/? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was reminded of the people over at /r/theredpill and the animation made sense to me because of how obnoxious those faggots are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because seeing their favorite game makes them break the character they've been playing to try and infiltrate the board #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much this #$%
@#$ $#@ what, you didnt like somers or lori? #$%
@#$ $#@ leddit the characters #$%
@#$ $#@ C'mon man, if you're going to shitpost you could at least try. #$%
@#$ $#@ Put some effort in. #$%
@#$ $#@ leddit the post #$%
@#$ $#@ Raccoon is top tier. #$%
@#$ $#@ you think i played this game? #$%
@#$ $#@ One would assume so, given that you seem to have strong opinions about it #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont play games by people I hate #$%
@#$ $#@ An obsession of sorts, I presume? #$%
@#$ $#@ especially with the whole "UGH" part #$%
@#$ $#@ not him, but I was curious about it until I found out how much of a trainwreck the dev is #$%
@#$ $#@ That porn tape of your mother sucking a midgets dick. #$%
@#$ $#@ This official cover seems to disagree. #$%
@#$ $#@ yeah see good call nitw shit for not having gameplay that's fine but that has nothing to do with the creator's personality/ideals that just means they have shit all direction when it comes to game design #$%
@#$ $#@ His post makes more sense then yours. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wont support an asshole with my money anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ PS2 had 10 trash games for every good one, not different from now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ When the staff of developers includes people with neon hair who think their gender is a fluid, you cant really expect quality. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're garbage fampilia desu #$%
@#$ $#@ shovelware definitely exists, but you never hear about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Development costs are higher, so there are less games being made in general. #$%
@#$ $#@ What does get made has higher standards than some of the best shit back then. #$%
@#$ $#@ The entire book is like that #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt even know it was possible to have such incredibly shit taste. #$%
@#$ $#@ You should have been aborted. #$%
@#$ $#@ my parents bought me a fucking minecraft handbook when i was like 17, i just looked at them like wtf do you guys think i have autism #$%
@#$ $#@ Vergil 3 #$%
@#$ $#@ That one, too. #$%
@#$ $#@ true kino #$%
@#$ $#@ what game? #$%
@#$ $#@ if kino were even a thing journey would be the definition of it #$%
@#$ $#@ The Legend Of Zelda: Majoras Mask. #$%
@#$ $#@ A Kinos Journey if you will. #$%
@#$ $#@ Came here to post this. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was such an intense moment if youd played the previous titles. #$%
@#$ $#@ into the east #$%
@#$ $#@ Majoras Mask is on the same level as BB, Killer 7, Silent Hill 2, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not like any other zelda, and it's not really for children. #$%
@#$ $#@ that scene was too much of a shift in tone #$%
@#$ $#@ From my understanding: Memorable / jaw dropping / emotional scenes that stick with you / leave an impression / make you emotional / you don't forget #$%
@#$ $#@ This, I wish the rest of the game wasnt a huge mess. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats Google, anyway? #$%
@#$ $#@ God Journey was fucking beautiful. #$%
@#$ $#@ underage and B&amp; #$%
@#$ $#@ If you have to ask, youll never know. #$%
@#$ $#@ There are to many good ones to list them here or even compare them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can list some anon, always interesting to hear about other kino scenes. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you shoot at nothing you got an extra level #$%
@#$ $#@ At least he still HAS a sister #$%
@#$ $#@ literally who? #$%
@#$ $#@ American McGee, level designer for Doom and Quake and developer of American McGees Alice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this true or /v/tard overreacting as usual because someone made money from video games? #$%
@#$ $#@ go back, millennial #$%
@#$ $#@ Nope, his mother literally named him fucking American McGee. #$%
@#$ $#@ didnt mean to quote, used that post for quick reply. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cared enough to post #$%
@#$ $#@ This planet doesn't have feelings because it's an inanimate fucking object, you retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off #$%
@#$ $#@ You raise a good point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting pregnant should require a IQ test leading to a license. #$%
@#$ $#@ I remember being 14, youre gonna grow out of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Read Gantz #$%
@#$ $#@ it's true #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd like to see this #$%
@#$ $#@ In Poland we have fuckton of babies names like Jessica and Brian, some of them are "polished" - Dżesika, Brajan. #$%
@#$ $#@ My cousin is named Xavier, with X and V. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thankfully it's become a normie meme and retarded parents are shamed for it #$%
@#$ $#@ American was getting threats from some anti-GG fruit that knew a little too much about his sister, but I think he said the police believe it was her boyfriend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you for this, Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, seriously, thank you. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have been suicidally depressed for a long, long time now. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was honestly, genuinely on the verge of killing myself. #$%
@#$ $#@ But now, you inspired me to do some more research on this Anthony Burch character. #$%
@#$ $#@ And now I have found a new will to live. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least I am not Anthony Burch. #$%
@#$ $#@ God bless you, Anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have a wonderful life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats literally not fair. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt abandoning a kid literally illegal, or am I missing something? #$%
@#$ $#@ In bruges #$%
@#$ $#@ Lmao, I never realized American McGee was an actual person. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought American McGees Alice was named like that because it was a USA version or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was a female hippy SJW and they are masters of being immune to law. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean American McGee wasnt as much of a figurehead on Quake and Doom like Carmack and Romero was. #$%
@#$ $#@ His life sounds like a TV drama #$%
@#$ $#@ You can do this thing called breaking a law. #$%
@#$ $#@ It;s where you take a law and then dont do what it says. #$%
@#$ $#@ He hired a private detective because the cops were inept. #$%
@#$ $#@ Private detective tracked down a hotel room his sister had been at and supposedly there was blood found in the room. #$%
@#$ $#@ His sister is presumed dead and no other search is on going. #$%
@#$ $#@ No closure at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Next youre gonna tell me no one remembers Adrian Carmack or Sandy Petersen, either. #$%
@#$ $#@ My mother did this to my fifteen year old little brother and she got no legal charges against her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shits fucked, yo. #$%
@#$ $#@ HE'S BROKE #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you're the father #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm surprised this guy turned out so good #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what happens when you're forced to think for yourself at a young age #$%
@#$ $#@ How is Xavier pronounced, because Ive seen at least three different ways to pronounce that name. #$%
@#$ $#@ Zay-vee-air, Cha-vee and Ha-vee-air #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK YOU, AND FUCK YOUR MARKER #$%
@#$ $#@ What the hell are these noises in the vents? #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why wouldnt I shoot the brain? #$%
@#$ $#@ Aw geez, aw shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guys I accidentally stabbed the Captain in the eye with a fucking needle. #$%
@#$ $#@ He fucking died from it. #$%
@#$ $#@ What do I do? #$%
@#$ $#@ Pffff shut up loser, everyone knows that aliens die from headshots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent you played halo? #$%
@#$ $#@ melee ideal for killing all necros #$%
@#$ $#@ Terrence, is that you? #$%
@#$ $#@ shut the fuck up Jayden, we'll throw your ass into space #$%
@#$ $#@ Who downloaded this "SHODAN" thing to my computer? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dunno, I went to see Rancid Moon for the 18th time and all the popcorn was replaced with these new steaks, which tasted like rotten pork and the lighting never got black, #$%
@#$ $#@ i &lt;3 dark soles #$%
@#$ $#@ you have some shit taste bro #$%
@#$ $#@ So youre the dumbass I keep hearing in the vents? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thought it was something else. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hey joe, you look different. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did yoy get a haircut? #$%
@#$ $#@ Zip-zop doobity bop! #$%
@#$ $#@ aw lordy, how am I supposed to win the Big Z-ball game with the space madness? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you going to try to seduce one or just rape? #$%
@#$ $#@ I heard derek got down with one after a candlelight dinner and a bottle of wine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking hell, I got catfished. #$%
@#$ $#@ There has been one eyeing me from across the atrium for some time now. #$%
@#$ $#@ She seemed upset that she cant get to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might go and try to talk to her tomorrow. #$%
@#$ $#@ 50 credits says you won't #$%
@#$ $#@ hey, when it works... #$%
@#$ $#@ Got my assault rifle ready. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thing is the best weapon for this kind of shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I figured out they needed some fertilizer. #$%
@#$ $#@ As nice as that would be, theres a good chance that they wont do that since EA doesnt see Dead Space as a money maker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why they forced the changes they did for 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Atleast owning actual weapons should stop those dickbag engineers from weaponizing the tools on board of the ship to shoot bottles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Let your pansy ass assault rifle can stand up to my disc launcher. #$%
@#$ $#@ I play Ultimaze Z-Frizzbee... #$%
@#$ $#@ for keeps! #$%
@#$ $#@ I wanna come with. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just play along with it, Unitology bitches put out more than a Lunar hooker. #$%
@#$ $#@ You just have to "yeah, uh-huh" them when they talk about their stupid moon cult. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unitology pussy is amazing. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are all freaks. #$%
@#$ $#@ who keeps dropping their wrench? #$%
@#$ $#@ We in medical are attempting to develop a cure for something most engineers have, autism. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jenkins is a hardcore alkie. #$%
@#$ $#@ WE WILL SEE WHO'S INSANE WHEN I'M WEARING YOUR SKIN AS A COAT #$%
@#$ $#@ It's still you, unitolobitch #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't give a shit if he's a hardcore jew, someone fire his ass or I'm gonna break all of the goddamn lights in the ship, and then everyone's gonna have to nagivate with flash lights or fucking lighters. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stub your toe on bulk head, see if I care! #$%
@#$ $#@ And someone pick up these ammo crates and medical boxes off the floor too! #$%
@#$ $#@ I keep tripping over them! #$%
@#$ $#@ This is a serious safety hazard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im callin my damn union rep if I trip over one of them again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Says the guy who has to flush twice because of his horrible rancid shits #$%
@#$ $#@ Your dog is now charred steak. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont worry. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hell grow out of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ but if that isnt him scraping on the vent above my stasis pod, what is it? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well maybe the gravity plating would be fine if some of us didn't try to rig them with BIG MEATY CLAWS #$%
@#$ $#@ We sleep in there. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its probably Jim taking pics of nude people again, crawling in the vents. #$%
@#$ $#@ Waifu claimed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because 9/10 other guys do that aswell idiot, you cant just lock up your entire tripulation. #$%
@#$ $#@ People say the games were just jump scares but they were all about that tension and they did that very well. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hah, its just a prank bro, we uploaded /b/ gore into your R.I.G. #$%
@#$ $#@ Please return all stasis and TK modules. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im getting reports that someone is rigging up stasis traps in the women restroom and we need to put a stop to this. #$%
@#$ $#@ When I find the fucker that is doing this I'm launching him to the new moon #$%
@#$ $#@ Get off the goddamn radio, Hitchens #$%
@#$ $#@ ATTENTION SECURITY PERSONNEL: THE CLOWN IS VALID. #$%
@#$ $#@ REPEAT, THE CLOWN IS VALID. #$%
@#$ $#@ GOOD HUNTING. #$%
@#$ $#@ So engineers can fit in there when required to fix shit, but lmao at the thought of them actually doing their job instead of fucking around with plasma cuters like children. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought we were going to the new moon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Lmao why should we care, wea re getting paid to jackoff and sleep #$%
@#$ $#@ Bullshit, sprawl engineers get way less space and get more shit done than these chucklefucks weve got. #$%
@#$ $#@ engineerfag go home #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh shit, praise the marker! #$%
@#$ $#@ Security here, fuck off already fags the lines are saturated with prank calls "beggin for help" or "do your job faggots" no fuck you, all ask nicely first then we will check. #$%
@#$ $#@ i hope you get shot by niggers on the sprawl #$%
@#$ $#@ Multiple people went on plasma cutter rampages or killed themselves. #$%
@#$ $#@ We need more men. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have some respect. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks OP, now I feel like playing this game for the 6th time. #$%
@#$ $#@ So, no worry about flesh eating parasites killing us and using our corpses to kill our friends and family, then? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whew, what a relief. #$%
@#$ $#@ If bio could make some decent veggies, we wouldnt be clogging up the toilets. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can Altman make my waifu real? #$%
@#$ $#@ you are supposed to EAT the tomatoes, not flush them whole down the toilet you crayon eating vent crawler. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up, unbelievers are not supposed to know about all this necromorph buisness. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those are tomatoes? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought they were red protein balls. #$%
@#$ $#@ What the fuck, bio? #$%
@#$ $#@ You will be one with your waifu when you give your body to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ wew, I'm spreading the good word of Altman from now on #$%
@#$ $#@ At least he didnt say anything about our tomb ships... #$%
@#$ $#@ No wonder youre here #$%
@#$ $#@ Stick your dick into the vents and piss into them. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one will know. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make us what? #$%
@#$ $#@ Make us whore? #$%
@#$ $#@ How fucking many stasis charges did you apply to your dick retard? #$%
@#$ $#@ They were supposed to be special tomatoes used as toppings for burgers and salads, but some dumb motherfucker calibrated the chems wrong and added pure shit water. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why greg hasnt been fired blows my mind. #$%
@#$ $#@ Call these useless engineers, the intercom's fucked again #$%
@#$ $#@ I WILL TRY THIS #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not that bad once you get into space. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its quite comfy as long as there are no human enemies. #$%
@#$ $#@ I might be biased because The Thing is my favorite movie and DS3 is the closest game thats related to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ My tomatoes always come with shitstains, poor hygiene from the Hydrophonic guys. #$%
@#$ $#@ oh fuck you steve, the intercom isnt broken just turn the dial back to where you found it. #$%
@#$ $#@ DS is good until about 1 hour after you hit the planet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Once you meet up with Ellie and crew, its pure shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just wait for meat moons and prepare your ass, fag. #$%
@#$ $#@ Make us whole again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats in it for me? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry honey, the grocery store only had white. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont be that guy who accidently snaps his dick off and ruins the fun for everyone, Joe. #$%
@#$ $#@ I already setup some of these on the vents for that fucking guy, I want to get some sleep ffs. #$%
@#$ $#@ I deadass replay Dead Space 2 once every week on Hardcore. #$%
@#$ $#@ someone is mad he had to clean human feces from his doorstep everyday. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're here forever #$%
@#$ $#@ He makes spectacular videos but I think hes just lost on Dead Space. #$%
@#$ $#@ These videos are nowhere near in depth as his other works and he focuses on some weird issues like criticizing the lore of DS2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also he doesnt seem to be that good at the game, judging by the gameplay clips in his videos. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes just spraying with the assault rifle. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spartan 4s are far weaker compared to 2s or even 3s. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halseys just butthurt that ONI threw her under the bus when the public got wind of their brainwashed child soldier shenanigans. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which she really should have expected from that group of Legion Of Doom rejects. #$%
@#$ $#@ Spartans who were trained from childhood arent, dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ Murphy literally died in service and in fact had a lot of trouble adjusting to society after World War 2 going so far as to sleep with a gun under his bed. #$%
@#$ $#@ That man would still be alive today otherwise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bit different when there is a genocidal alien empire and a species that absorbs all bio matter in the universe. #$%
@#$ $#@ Neither of which were known to humanity when the SPARTAN project was greenlit. #$%
@#$ $#@ John is good because he's the PRO-TAH-GOH-NUST #$%
@#$ $#@ But thats not the case at all, the Master Chief is like Tenchi where the three goddesses created a being that would surpass them that happened to be that particular person, Chief was just lucky enough to be that Reclaimer that the Librarian planted the seeds for 100,000 years ago. #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds really mary sueish #$%
@#$ $#@ No, its not, you are reading into that cutscene too much. #$%
@#$ $#@ All it was saying is that the librarian arranged geases to subtly push humanity into devolping supersoliders with power armor and AI's, it's not about cheif at all as an indivual. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really that likes 0.001 chance any human would be lucky enough to have the Librarians genesong placed in them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Chief was just that lucky guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The suits are what make the SIV's powerful, they lack the augmentations at the level the SII's have. #$%
@#$ $#@ Believing Meme IVs can compete with niggas blessed by ancient aliums, have over 25 years of experience and are gods of death on the battlefield. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah naw buddy if you're going to make a halo lore thread don't be dumb about the lore. #$%
@#$ $#@ But Chief beat his ass and "Locked" the bitch in his place. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because she activated an immunity to the composer that had been placed in humanity's genes in general, he's not the choosen one or anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ you first. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only reason he was in was because Brian Reed had his dick on for Spartan IVs, he got fired for it and I never felt more better about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't that a S3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Red team from HW2 with shieldless Mk IV Mjolnir could spank SIVs around. #$%
@#$ $#@ He got fired? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank fucking god maybe we can get ODST back in again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre doubling down on Master Chief for the future of Halo thank god. #$%
@#$ $#@ See I saw that but didnt know he got fired. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now they just need to get rid of everyone they hired that hates halo and publicly execute bonnie and kiki. #$%
@#$ $#@ Halo 5 was so fucking shit and I don't know who in their right mind thought people gave a single fuck about their token minorities crew and Nathan Fillion who couldn't stop talking about how the chief was a cool guy. #$%
@#$ $#@ They took the coolest marines the ODST and replaced em with fuckign SIVs like retards. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you turn easy on too? #$%
@#$ $#@ Whats with the record scratches? #$%
@#$ $#@ Gods like music as well, anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got you, my man. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not this again. #$%
@#$ $#@ I liked it too especially how she spills spaghetti all over the place. #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought the same way, but maybe because I dont have a little sister. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes terrible the whole game, everyone who enjoys her company just fell for the pandering trash she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ shes better in her social link #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't really see how she's supposed to be "unlikable", it's the party that becomes full of retards and it's not the only time but yes, there is changes later #$%
@#$ $#@ posting best girl instead #$%
@#$ $#@ Post more feet :O #$%
@#$ $#@ she seems bland #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd say that it's a good things even if you don't waifu her, it brings a biit of variety to the cast, like Yusuke and his kind-of-autism too #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba is for cuddling, headpat, and talking about HDD all night along. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes probably one of my favorite male persona party member post 3, period. #$%
@#$ $#@ Especially because when it's important he's still usually better at getting a hint than the others. #$%
@#$ $#@ kill yourself feetfag furry motherfucker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks anon #$%
@#$ $#@ It actually makes me sad that there are some people who don't realize this on /v/ #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty sure most people figured it out considering they are posting the futaba manga edits #$%
@#$ $#@ Please tell me thats what she calls her penis. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is futaba a reference to 2ch? #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres also a group of anonymous hackers and all. #$%
@#$ $#@ r u fuckingn gay dude lmao #$%
@#$ $#@ Persona has always been a bit lackluster in art, we'll probably have to wait a good time before a lot of new things are made, sadly #$%
@#$ $#@ Half of the people in this thread will become kaifu fetichists because of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fanarts kind of annoying to find nowadays. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese artists have been moving away from pixiv and onto twitter where it's a hassle finding things because most of them don't bother tagging their shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess I can be happy with what I have. #$%
@#$ $#@ her boobs are not that big #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually like this better than on Ann, even if she still has way too much breasts on this one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or at least it looks like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You posted one I don't have, thanks Anon #$%
@#$ $#@ We would take breaks then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just retarded memers trying to make you feel bad for liking her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just ignore them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not a single person would make me feel bad for liking her, they could try though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jokes on them, her being an imouto will only make it better #$%
@#$ $#@ There is literally nothing wrong with friendless nerds wearing revealing clothing. #$%
@#$ $#@ She just likes being comfy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Comfy is a t-shirt and sweatpants. #$%
@#$ $#@ Isn't she more confident by the time she wears her sluttier clothes though #$%
@#$ $#@ Her surprised face is by far her cutest look #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto would be a wonderful little autistic daughter #$%
@#$ $#@ I always find this picture adorable #$%
@#$ $#@ she looks pretty comfy in this #$%
@#$ $#@ That is not as slutty as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ But besides that, Im scared of people and I like to wear as little clothing as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ Heck, it's easier to do so when there's no people around. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody to judge you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not that bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its definitely a strong smell, but you get used to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I know what you mean about the NG+ thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Whenever I play a game that lets you romance someone, I never pick anyone else once I choose in my first playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im sick in the head. #$%
@#$ $#@ How does your ass crack smell after a couple days without getting washed? #$%
@#$ $#@ Like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is futaba thread, you can post harus if she's with futaba #$%
@#$ $#@ We need more people who are alright with other waifus #$%
@#$ $#@ Spicy stuff, you guys sure are aggressive #$%
@#$ $#@ The redpill in this situation is starting a family with both Haru and Futaba #$%
@#$ $#@ Or panties/boxers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Polygamy is a crime #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't be rude, we don't need people thinking we are all a bunch of jerks. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your face is a crime. #$%
@#$ $#@ Were all friends here anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its 90% people shooting the shit and just having some fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ And even then, Ohyas only crime is having a boring slink and a shitty confidant skill. #$%
@#$ $#@ I still hung around her because Crossroads was a fun place and Lala-chan was tons more interesting than Ohya. #$%
@#$ $#@ Forgot image. #$%
@#$ $#@ Haru is your wife and Futaba is your loving daughter #$%
@#$ $#@ All waifutards are ok, the only ones that bother me are the ones trying to turn all character threads into pure nsfw #$%
@#$ $#@ If I owned any you can be damn sure Id be wearing hotpants at home. #$%
@#$ $#@ Short shorts are comfy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thigh highs are apparently comfy too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, I cant speak of hotpants. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having a dick and balls kind of hinders that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Different strokes for different folks I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ I spend most of my time naked or in underwear since on most days I'm not leaving the house, nobody's coming to see me, and clothes are a bother. #$%
@#$ $#@ No but I am #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad bub that's official art #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm a Christian and I'm fine with it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not for me, but who am I to tell you what to do as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else? #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba calls Justin Wong #$%
@#$ $#@ I want the building I'm in to be crushed by Futaba's hips! #$%
@#$ $#@ Would Haru be okay with coming home to seeing her daughter spread eagle with you? #$%
@#$ $#@ As a current neet piece of shit who rarely leaves home, I hate wearing the same clothes I went to bed in every day and throw on a regular outfit even when I dont plan on going out. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its sort of my way of dealing with day to day repetition of doing nothing, I guess. #$%
@#$ $#@ It becomes a term of endearment over time and has a very light tone of dom to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think she means it seriously. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not my thing but I get why people like it. #$%
@#$ $#@ In my headcanon where I gladly drink her elephant shit coffee and run a store with her she is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Comfortable people are sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ God I love these #$%
@#$ $#@ I totally get that. #$%
@#$ $#@ It can also give that small sense of accomplishment/not complete worthlessness. #$%
@#$ $#@ My ex worked the same way. #$%
@#$ $#@ For me it's just that as long as I shower and such every day, I'm good. #$%
@#$ $#@ When I start letting that go I feel pretty... #$%
@#$ $#@ discarded and worthless. #$%
@#$ $#@ My headcanon is pretty close to this desu #$%
@#$ $#@ I guess to some people she seems much more platonic #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its funny how endearing just being comfortable is. #$%
@#$ $#@ Post futabu pictures? #$%
@#$ $#@ pic related #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a special bond with Futaba... #$%
@#$ $#@ Like the soap I bathed with, since I wipe well...unlike you from the sound of it. #$%
@#$ $#@ So theres nothing to worry about for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi, Sean #$%
@#$ $#@ Aoi Yuki is THE CUTEST #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba is too smol there to really savor that pic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just a weird translation since speaking in an extremely concise way is colloquially correct in Japanese. #$%
@#$ $#@ She...Is autistic tho? #$%
@#$ $#@ In a good way #$%
@#$ $#@ For real? #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been here almost all day and missed it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish they removed this goddamn lock on PS4 screens at least, even if they don't for videos, it'd make it SO much easier to share things and take good pictures. #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you have a link or something? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fishing for pics #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba is too cute to turn down! #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not her age. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's the fact that she feels like family #$%
@#$ $#@ To you maybe, to me, she was a perfectly romancing friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Would you fuck your little sister #$%
@#$ $#@ Where is this even from? #$%
@#$ $#@ also, did she stole this vest from Kanji? #$%
@#$ $#@ Good thing Futaba isn't a little sister type at all and doesn't even feel like it then #$%
@#$ $#@ Makoto is pretty cool desu. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kawakami and Hifumi are also great. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uh huh. #$%
@#$ $#@ from what Ive heard someone zoomed on a scene because it was too small for him or something like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see which scene this is supposed to be maybe when it sstartssnowing after the final boss? #$%
@#$ $#@ But I dud it again recently and she didn't look that way but I'm always amazed with the quality it has despite being resized. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dated Kawakami on Xmas and got no such scene. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it only for certain girls? #$%
@#$ $#@ I wish I could, but Futabas way better anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's joke #$%
@#$ $#@ Its due to his Persona being a trickster and a rebel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Jokers pull alot of tricks in lores and myths. #$%
@#$ $#@ I will have nightmares tonight because of this. #$%
@#$ $#@ That anon is mistaken, its a fan creation from pixiv. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also the relation between teh Fool tarot card and the Joker card. #$%
@#$ $#@ because The Fool is seen as a wildcard in card games involving tarot cards, Joker cards function the same way in modern playing card decks #$%
@#$ $#@ feels weird since it looks like ituses the real sprites but it makes more sense this way yeah #$%
@#$ $#@ just let me know #$%
@#$ $#@ Did you not play 4? #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you please stop being such a crybaby bastard? #$%
@#$ $#@ Did Pixiv do something to alienate its userbase again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I did, I just think that they look terrible on her, despite the fact that even her memeglasses look good to me #$%
@#$ $#@ there were 2 futaba futa pics 6 months ago #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you slow anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ Of course its also JoJo references. #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba was the only one I feel like I could romance everyone else just got worse the more I spent time with them #$%
@#$ $#@ Yea we want to talk about real games like Gone Home or Revolution 60. #$%
@#$ $#@ Optimal headpat height #$%
@#$ $#@ Get Smoked &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MAGA #$%
@#$ $#@ GET SMOTE &gt; ALL #$%
@#$ $#@ That fucking smirk though. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just doesnt fit the context of the situation #$%
@#$ $#@ In what way does it not fit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Shes super happy. #$%
@#$ $#@ The events where you hang out with Ryuji are unironically better than hanging out with a girl anyways. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too many filthy gaijin #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been too busy playing the actual game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is she taller in this pic? #$%
@#$ $#@ or is akira holding her up? #$%
@#$ $#@ Futaba is fun size! #$%
@#$ $#@ should change it to eff that fag #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont wanna buy a new copy of the same thing every year or face being stuck with an inferior version. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also has Neji, the greatest bro and wingman to ever exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ It also has Tenten, the greatest sis and wingwoman to ever exist #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm enjoying boruto, but wtf is up with boruto having the bakyugan while he didn't even have it in the movie. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats just bad writing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Asuras warth. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean if you have nothing else going on 720 episodes can really pass the time. #$%
@#$ $#@ clash of ninja and ultimate ninja ps2 series are the ones you should be checking out. #$%
@#$ $#@ storm series is shit imo. #$%
@#$ $#@ all style no substance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wii Fit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Naruto is worth watching until the end of the Chunin exams. #$%
@#$ $#@ After that it is unwatchable, including Shippuden. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont bother. #$%
@#$ $#@ the original series is alright, the second series starts out interesting enough, but quickly goes down the shitter #$%
@#$ $#@ From what I've heard he's pretty good in UNS3 #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a Naruto fighting game. #$%
@#$ $#@ That means everyone will animate differently, but essentially play 90% the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres zero need to worry about an imbalance. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unless their cutscene attack is impossible to hit with, youre going to be essentially on even footing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Objectively superior taste right here. #$%
@#$ $#@ the ds games are good #$%
@#$ $#@ Not outside of the exceptionally well animated episodes, read the manga instead #$%
@#$ $#@ storm 4 is the latest one and it's been said they don't plan on making any more shippuuden storm games. #$%
@#$ $#@ the next new game that contains rock lee will probably have him as an adult from boruto #$%
@#$ $#@ No but it's worth reading #$%
@#$ $#@ Both of your braincells are contrarian. #$%
@#$ $#@ what exactly is this describing? #$%
@#$ $#@ the maps? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are these pictures of the Zero Escape timelines? #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck do you think? #$%
@#$ $#@ mechanical flaws like actual character builds, you mean? #$%
@#$ $#@ thats not how the fucking maps work at all though you fucking faggot #$%
@#$ $#@ This is absolutely, objectively, statistically and factually true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ur moms a shit boss fight #$%
@#$ $#@ DS3 by far. #$%
@#$ $#@ If 2's main game was as good as their DLC's, then it would probably be better. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt a big fan of some of the balance changes they made, since I think the game felt clunky and movement felt sluggish. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, mechanical flaws like the hitbox problem I mentioned, among other stuff like awful balancing, lack of responsive from controls, glitches, Bed Of fucking Chaos, etc. #$%
@#$ $#@ I actually got so sick of his gauntlet that I just used a greatshield and made him my bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ It felt so unsatisfying that I never touched the DLCs a second time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Souls 2 had a lot of flaws, but it was the best in terms of early game options you could essentially go to any boss early game in what ever order, hell if you exploited bonfire ascetics you could have you dream build faster then any other soul #$%
@#$ $#@ backed up my save before the boss desu #$%
@#$ $#@ Got him just now. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt a bad fight but the path to him made learning his fight pretty BS. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slowly go? #$%
@#$ $#@ You could just run to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why couldnt the Slayer of Demons go to the final boss immediately again? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not like they ask you to gather boss souls or anything in that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Won't ask you about the first, but i don't remember the second one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since it's the Maiden who opens it and not you, she wants to have you ready by killing archdemons, but she could've opened it anytime, no? #$%
@#$ $#@ this isn't level design, it's world interconnectivity #$%
@#$ $#@ DS1&gt;DS3&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;faulty souls #$%
@#$ $#@ Wheres the part on the DS3 map where you can do the Boreal Dancer early and clear out like three other areas? #$%
@#$ $#@ First thing you do is run down and smelter wedge that idol. #$%
@#$ $#@ There everything after that you should be able to handle by git'n gud #$%
@#$ $#@ Dude, DaS3 had the least viable builds. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are literally gimping yourself if you try to kill shit with a Lance instead of a Greataxe #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, I realized to just run down and hop along the middle parts to get there before any enemies could get to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I want to fight things in their prime not old decrepit versions #$%
@#$ $#@ doesn't count #$%
@#$ $#@ No question #$%
@#$ $#@ DS2 character quests were garbage though. #$%
@#$ $#@ So are DS3 ones, but at least they tried. #$%
@#$ $#@ lol, no #$%
@#$ $#@ It takes 2 and a half minutes though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant get past the silky smooth 24 FPS of Bloodborne, and I have a pro. #$%
@#$ $#@ I couldnt be bothered with this as it was the last boss left so I just summoned everyone and massacred my way through. #$%
@#$ $#@ They were pretty effective. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pate was basically a cheap imitation of Patches. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd like to see them with area names #$%
@#$ $#@ After enough tries kill off all the horses it feels more like half an hour though. #$%
@#$ $#@ There is absolutely no point or justification for having a bonfire this far from the boss other than intentionally being a smug asshole. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2 is best, then 1 and 3 is last #$%
@#$ $#@ Id hardly consider a 2 and half minute walk this far. #$%
@#$ $#@ Frigid Outskirts is basically Lost Izalith, but for multiplayer. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean theyre called challenge areas for a reason. #$%
@#$ $#@ And thankfully all three are optional. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly the whole game feels like youre playing underwater. #$%
@#$ $#@ Probably why ultra weapons dominate pve so hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stuff like the incredibly slow camera movement until you push the stick halfway where it suddenly shoots to infinity doesnt help. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seeing that giant rat filled me with nostalgia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dark Souls 1 had such good level design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wtf happened #$%
@#$ $#@ Then the real problem here is those 30+ tries. #$%
@#$ $#@ With one or two people with you those should have been 5 at most. #$%
@#$ $#@ Vitality isnt very important, it just raises your equip load very slighty. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt recommend it. #$%
@#$ $#@ The second half of it happened. #$%
@#$ $#@ internet fights in a nutshell #$%
@#$ $#@ For the people who could beat the boss almost immediately it would have made no practical difference if they had put a bonfire at the end of that snowy path, and for the people who couldnt, it only served as a waste of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ You can't convince me it's not pointless design decision. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats modded skyrim innit? #$%
@#$ $#@ Isnt that medallion incorrect? #$%
@#$ $#@ It took me a while. #$%
@#$ $#@ Explain this then genius. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yoko Taro asked the modellers to create the most perfect ass ever, makes lots of sense to me. #$%
@#$ $#@ the loose material was subjected to more damage from the explosion than the taught material #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont understand. #$%
@#$ $#@ So she likes people staring, but only at her body rather than her face? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is her butt so shiny? #$%
@#$ $#@ wtf will all the medallions? #$%
@#$ $#@ is there an explanation for that ? #$%
@#$ $#@ She actually wants to seduce a prepubescent200+ year old boy #$%
@#$ $#@ Her butt is wet #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes, but only because scars on her face. #$%
@#$ $#@ giv ciri gf #$%
@#$ $#@ Why is it always wet in every screenshot? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the mildest form of fan service Ive ever seen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wouldnt even go so far as to call it fan service. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because a bunch of people like wet butts and take screenshots of it? #$%
@#$ $#@ The in-game reason is that they are androids made by humans, and humans wanted them to look sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty fucking simple #$%
@#$ $#@ Shed rather they stare with a favorable gaze towards her chest than one of disgust and fear over her scars. #$%
@#$ $#@ Toobie was built for sex. #$%
@#$ $#@ taro likes girls #$%
@#$ $#@ Aint got to explain shit nigga. #$%
@#$ $#@ You gay or something son? #$%
@#$ $#@ So OP being a faggot is no a meme after all. #$%
@#$ $#@ Toobie is for lov! #$%
@#$ $#@ No lewds! #$%
@#$ $#@ Two things is far from everything #$%
@#$ $#@ I might be tedious for you, which is unfortunate for you but has nothing to do with me. #$%
@#$ $#@ they literally subvert almost everything #$%
@#$ $#@ Would rather explain why she's wearing clothes at all #$%
@#$ $#@ how is being and assman related to anal? #$%
@#$ $#@ both holes are very close to each other and accessible from both sides #$%
@#$ $#@ The right clothes make a sexy woman more sexy #$%
@#$ $#@ It's something she's in control of. #$%
@#$ $#@ we're postpostpostmodern desu #$%
@#$ $#@ Well anon, theres being an assman and a titsman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anal means more images that focus on her ass instead of her breasts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not about being a numale. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its about not having the taste of a caveman you semen ridden knuckledragger. #$%
@#$ $#@ it's not like vaginal is gonna be breast focused either #$%
@#$ $#@ Well anon, Id wager that most people categorize vaginas in the assman package. #$%
@#$ $#@ The choice is between the upper half titsman or the lower half of the female body assman. #$%
@#$ $#@ How much more do I have to explain, boy? #$%
@#$ $#@ Even if she was she wouldn't be near your sorry ass #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you never seen a cobblestone street before? #$%
@#$ $#@ Were you born in fucking 2015? #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep being a literal construction worker for your entire life. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does Geralt keep letting her pretend to be a Witcher? #$%
@#$ $#@ She doesn't have the cat eyes, and all the medallions he gives her to pretend with it's,from those fuckboy cat school faggots. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wont stop me from loving her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only a redditor would be this mean-spirited #$%
@#$ $#@ Games are not art you imbecile, theyre just that; games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its because it makes my pee pee feisty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Japanese devs arent cock guzzling homosexual cucks, that cave to SJWs and the 5 million different genders that make up the group. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games are fucking art you retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ They take storytelling, visual arts, music, animation, architecture, and acting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Games are the highest form of art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gameplay in and of itself is art as well, being that its quality is derived from the ability to connect the dots between all of the other artforms which comprise the game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ciri is flat anyway #$%
@#$ $#@ If I were at my parents place, I could literally walk ten minutes into the historical part of our town, take a picture and show you that this is how it actually looked like when the stonemasons where lazy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where do you need to be to write in English without sounding retarded? #$%
@#$ $#@ Planescape torment did have tits and ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ It had eroticism, not fanservice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hi, retard. #$%
@#$ $#@ but why did they design her that way tho? #$%
@#$ $#@ Couldnt she just breathe like a normal human? #$%
@#$ $#@ Kojima never made a good point on it and i dont know why feminist sjws never complained about it #$%
@#$ $#@ What history revisionist meme tier horseshit have you been listening too this time anon? #$%
@#$ $#@ can you stop being so gay #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you and I are speaking on different wavelengths my friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ i like how human babes and asian babes are different #$%
@#$ $#@ nothing will get close to guwap bruh fym #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats like calling monopoly art because someone had to illustrate the board. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grow up and let go of your childish little games, kid. #$%
@#$ $#@ they need to go back and make The End wear a banana hammock #$%
@#$ $#@ Okay, and the height of Rome wasnt anywhere near medieval times. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, they didn't even have club technology back then #$%
@#$ $#@ Games are just things for wasting time, i cant believe you could ever call them art. #$%
@#$ $#@ Postironic applied memetics are crushing postmodernism shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Every piece of art can be said to be a "thing for wasting time", though. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Gladius wasnt their main weapon though. #$%
@#$ $#@ The Pilum had that honor. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ciri is just hot, simply as that #$%
@#$ $#@ isnt it vesemirs? #$%
@#$ $#@ Stupid physique #$%
@#$ $#@ you are stupid tbqh #$%
@#$ $#@ go fuck yourself #$%
@#$ $#@ Ciri has a nice normal body and not this tumor abomination. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking skyrimshitters, I swear to god. #$%
@#$ $#@ She's made to look appealing because her whole job is to gain other androids' trust so they let her put them out of their misery when the time comes. #$%
@#$ $#@ but Ciri is pretty thicc #$%
@#$ $#@ it's the truth though #$%
@#$ $#@ I want all thickmemers rot in hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ this guys a virgin, never been with a fit / muscular woman in his life lol sad kid #$%
@#$ $#@ It's not a meme, can't you just see how thicc she is? #$%
@#$ $#@ No, I wouldnt. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its retarded. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are a man of fine taste #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont mind gays but at least have some real life explanation for why. #$%
@#$ $#@ wait she has scars on her face? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the latest in being responsible with an expensive and multi function item. #$%
@#$ $#@ You think you could just walk down to the pound store and pick up a high quality belt in medieval times? #$%
@#$ $#@ are you blind? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is what happens when a generation of men get raised by single moms and told by teachers and the internet that being attracted to women for physical reasons is shameful #$%
@#$ $#@ Never realized she has stitch marks alongside it as well #$%
@#$ $#@ Androids dont really seem to have sexual attraction though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I mean the whole bunker is pretty much filled with 10/10s; one more wouldnt be any different. #$%
@#$ $#@ The real reason is because the design is attractive and memorable, which is what matters the most considering that 2B is essentially a marketing tool #$%
@#$ $#@ I do love me some scarred women #$%
@#$ $#@ This is what happens when youre born in burgerland and your whole education system fails at teaching you reading comprehension. #$%
@#$ $#@ skyrim is honestly an amazing game, Jeez Louise #$%
@#$ $#@ Developers should be asking "Why not?" #$%
@#$ $#@ The thing is that Quiet is has literally no sex appeal. #$%
@#$ $#@ They tried so hard to sexualize her that they did a 360 and it ended up back on not being sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's so blatant and so in your face and without tact that it loses all effect, it comes off as extremely pathetic, especially in how it clashes with the tone of the rest of the game.The same was true of the BB unit in 4, it's like they got a 12 year old in charge of making things sexy. #$%
@#$ $#@ taut, you retard #$%
@#$ $#@ *heavy breathing* please, I can only handle so much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ciri will obviously make a cameo in Cyberpunk, don't fret you'll see best girl then! #$%
@#$ $#@ I hope we can fuck her then! #$%
@#$ $#@ Sorry, but Ciri is not for lewds. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too late for that senpai #$%
@#$ $#@ All the main Elder Scrolls games are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again, a Tarkovsky film would only be worsened but unnecessary fanservice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beauty is not so simple as just putting the most attractive shit together. #$%
@#$ $#@ the smooth rocks probably feel great but i can only imagine kicking that one bastard stone popping out #$%
@#$ $#@ not an insult, just a fact about who you are as a human being and that fact renders your opinion worthless #$%
@#$ $#@ Too bad its going to be years before we see anything witcher again from CDPR. #$%
@#$ $#@ Possibly a decade. #$%
@#$ $#@ Claiming somebody else is samefagging is the dumbest, most pointless and devoid of significance form of shitposting. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not even OP if itserves of anything to you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not in my headcanon though #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, is this from Skyrim? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the ultimate anime dress up game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though to be honest I have spent more time having Lightning molested than Ciri in that game. #$%
@#$ $#@ A new elder scrolls game cant some soon enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh right, her face is up there. #$%
@#$ $#@ My mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was mostly talking about video game characters with big tits in general actually #$%
@#$ $#@ Please kill yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ I always think cute girls are mega cute with makeup. #$%
@#$ $#@ Like, actually without it and not just where they have makeup that is tough to notice. #$%
@#$ $#@ Something about their eyes seems more human, and maybe a bit younger. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ugly girls look way fucking worse without it though, which I also like because seeing all girls without it makes it more obvious who the good ones are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too busy looking at her open blouse #$%
@#$ $#@ what were we talking about? #$%
@#$ $#@ I need the name of this mod and I need it now #$%
@#$ $#@ just jdimsa in my sleep already #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm sorry, I don't know. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just saved someones screenshots. #$%
@#$ $#@ My wife Ciri is too cute for this world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait, seriously? #$%
@#$ $#@ Do you remember the source for the artificial womb stuff? #$%
@#$ $#@ wtf i want to lewd ciri now #$%
@#$ $#@ Nier Automata #$%
@#$ $#@ The randomness of the ending was so ridiculous in this game I have even forgotten about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now I'm mad again #$%
@#$ $#@ say that about my daughter again, I dare you #$%
@#$ $#@ If I knew that it was some sex-starved gamer who dressed her, Id probably have some questions, yes. #$%
@#$ $#@ How naive of you to think they leave their house regularly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like her scars too, but real life scars dont look like this at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ In the book they were quite gruesome. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this Loss? #$%
@#$ $#@ What a shame #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont ever let your country lose that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youll go down a dark, dark road if you do. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because real life women make the choice to dress like sluts, vidya women are "forced" by MEN to dress like sluts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Or something like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ People are stupid, thats all there is to it. #$%
@#$ $#@ You're retarded #$%
@#$ $#@ fugg I need this game but don't want to spend $60 #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait till the steam summer sale. #$%
@#$ $#@ Implying it will go on sale anytime in the next year #$%
@#$ $#@ Entirely subjective. #$%
@#$ $#@ Odds are the writers did try, they just think differently than you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't like it, don't buy it. #$%
@#$ $#@ It will #$%
@#$ $#@ Your just making shit up #$%
@#$ $#@ But anon think what about what they could of done if they were armed with clubs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Women have breasts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck do you need an explanation for that, dumbass? #$%
@#$ $#@ Postmodernism is cancer, plain and simple. #$%
@#$ $#@ And no, Witcher 3 is not in any way whatsoever postmodern. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think you need to look up what that word means. #$%
@#$ $#@ What you want from video games is ridiculous. #$%
@#$ $#@ Go join a medieval reenactment group or something. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plenty exist. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hearts of Stone #$%
@#$ $#@ You arent getting her point. #$%
@#$ $#@ The simple fact that sexy armor exists is oppressive ans sexist #$%
@#$ $#@ that "her" is a good touch though #$%
@#$ $#@ So make a game about being a medieval grunt with realistic body physics? #$%
@#$ $#@ Things dont just come into existence because you want them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You are mentally impaired. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kek, you western faggots know nothing about comfiness that comes from it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I despise you with all my slav beeing #$%
@#$ $#@ That is a really stupid hat #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you seriously surprised a guy who would put a gun up to her fucking head, probably with the full intention of shooting her, would knock her towel off? #$%
@#$ $#@ why are being an intellectual and being overweight mutually exclusive? #$%
@#$ $#@ but she doesnt have that scar on her right eye? #$%
@#$ $#@ CDPR only gave her the little one on her left, much wimpier than the books described it as. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a Cat School medallion she acquires from this dude who had been killing witchers. #$%
@#$ $#@ She killed him, and from the three, I think, he had on him, she took the Cat School one as a trophy. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUND IT #$%
@#$ $#@ Not if it isn't cracked #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel the same, Id only like to add I think its best when its a form follows function thing, like in Haunting Ground. #$%
@#$ $#@ Absolutely agreed. #$%
@#$ $#@ people still care about her? #$%
@#$ $#@ her blouse doesn't have buttons #$%
@#$ $#@ The ass was too beautiful for this world. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too pure #$%
@#$ $#@ part of a main quest if you go with the "wrong" dialogue options #$%
@#$ $#@ Her batteries are in that ass OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's a Wolf Medallion, Cat for reference #$%
@#$ $#@ Don't hate us all, we're not all such degenerates such as that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Unlike kojima Yoko Taro is pretty straightforward in why he design toobie like that, dudes pretty based. #$%
@#$ $#@ Keep your fanfiction from established in game canon. #$%
@#$ $#@ to be fair, Mass Effect Andromedas budget was literally half that of Witcher 3, and they had to actually pay people western game industry wages. #$%
@#$ $#@ CDPR was allowed to pay a bunch of slavs a few dimes a week for their services. #$%
@#$ $#@ GOD DAMN. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you read the Kodex near the end on the playthrough of ending c, it will be revealed that she's wears that because her creator wanted you to jack off to a sexy fictional video game character #$%
@#$ $#@ Construction workers make, like, $80k. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yet, somehow, theres a gigantic shortage of construction workers, because no one wants to be a construction worker. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love how they went through the trouble of modeling her squished nipple on her shirt, attention to detail. #$%
@#$ $#@ don't be ridiculous, women don't have breasts, let alone big ones, and even less on attractive women, which are also a myth, btw. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sometimes they did it as a status symbol. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kinda like "I don't need this much belt but I sure as shit want everyone to see I can afford it" #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive never played it do they all have belt weenies? #$%
@#$ $#@ What is this from? #$%
@#$ $#@ That hairstyle is so god damn hot on her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it in witcher or skyrim? #$%
@#$ $#@ Why does he wear the suit? #$%
@#$ $#@ There's also rumors of a possible Sony Smash 2, but you know, they're rumors. #$%
@#$ $#@ I expect to see bullshit #$%
@#$ $#@ As always #$%
@#$ $#@ What about Sly 5 when? #$%
@#$ $#@ Apparently the movie is in trouble so I wouldn't hold my breath #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would they even make a movie before properly ending the characters story? #$%
@#$ $#@ Parappa 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Mostly generic garbage, you know, the only thing Sony gets for their console these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why would you want gameplay, dude? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sony gives the best cinematic experiences, you know, for the players! #$%
@#$ $#@ And Jumping Flash 4 #$%
@#$ $#@ Knock it off you goofballs #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't care if this is ironic, we all know this kind of person exists somewhere #$%
@#$ $#@ demons souls remastered calling it now #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds fucking retard, so you might be right #$%
@#$ $#@ The kind of person that buys video game consoles to watch movies and play movies? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well, of course, theyre the main user base of the PS4. #$%
@#$ $#@ A bunch of Western like games that I will have little to no interest in, along with some updates on the previous ones they announced years ago that havent been released. #$%
@#$ $#@ Will it have balloon missions? #$%
@#$ $#@ That was actually cool as shit #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Darkseid's supermove #$%
@#$ $#@ his stance looks so cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ the game im most excited for this year. #$%
@#$ $#@ preordered it on friday and im so excited. #$%
@#$ $#@ i want to try darkseid and cheetah right off the bat. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive been on the fence, but he just singlehandedly sold the game for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nothin, you? #$%
@#$ $#@ thats pretty cool #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Granny Goodness in this one? #$%
@#$ $#@ You won't fool anyone here with that kind of bait #$%
@#$ $#@ why do his laser eyes bend like that? #$%
@#$ $#@ dunno much about DC. #$%
@#$ $#@ game still looks really cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Grapefruit aren't purple #$%
@#$ $#@ The lasers are called the Omega Sanction. #$%
@#$ $#@ They can track a target anywhere in the universe and are virtually impossible to avoid. #$%
@#$ $#@ They bend to alter their course to the target and because it looks cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ explain how Batman dodged it once #$%
@#$ $#@ He didnt really dodge it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Someone else just took the hit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plot armor trumps all #$%
@#$ $#@ Writers do whatever the fuck they want. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you buying the goy edition or normal? #$%
@#$ $#@ Me too man #$%
@#$ $#@ Well the Omega Beams have been able to go through matter and avoid most shit in their way to track their target. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is mostly down to writers decide what they want them to be capable off this time if he ever uses it at all, easier to just not make Darkseid use it so fans don't complain when the hero obviously doesn't die #$%
@#$ $#@ Never been a fan of this character but man, NRS did such a great job with him in I2 that I want to main him and Supergirl #$%
@#$ $#@ both though marvel to a more extreme extent #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of them are. #$%
@#$ $#@ BB is probably the best example of a fighting game providing you with enough singleplayer content to be able to stand up on that alone. #$%
@#$ $#@ Several different modes, a long story mode you actually get to play the game in unlike Xrd where its just movies, and fun challenges to fuck around in. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes probably one of the 9 DLC characters along with Black Manta. #$%
@#$ $#@ What are pic relateds chances of being DLC? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never liked angsty superman. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wish they got Ironside to come back. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty high due to the demand for the first one and the Watchmen/DC universe crossover we got going on now #$%
@#$ $#@ Would be amazing if they actually went through with it, but I kinda doubt it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Absolutely zero because this game will be dead before the comics finally roll around to the Watchmen stuff. #$%
@#$ $#@ worst joker design I have ever seen #$%
@#$ $#@ What is everything so yellow? #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck off idiot #$%
@#$ $#@ It's just the stage's lighting. #$%
@#$ $#@ catwoman/supergirl and robin/black canary #$%
@#$ $#@ no they are fine #$%
@#$ $#@ I love when Superman has scenes like that. #$%
@#$ $#@ He really just is the personification of what it is to be a good person. #$%
@#$ $#@ Can MCUcks even compete? #$%
@#$ $#@ If you actually read comics, youd love Flash. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's retardedly OP #$%
@#$ $#@ Ollie is rich as shit but complains about the poor and underpriviliged. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's a bleeding heart liberal that even gets on Dinah's nerves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hal is conservative as hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ The two, despite supposedly, fucking Ollie wouldn't even take in Hal off the street when he couldn't hold a job down while simultaneously being space cop being very good friends, butt heads regularly. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's the world's boyscout. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dem digits #$%
@#$ $#@ nobody gives a shit about them the only good ones are reptile and eren black #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, Kirbyseid and Johnseid are two very different entities, while Thanos has been written consistently by Starlin for most of his existence. #$%
@#$ $#@ why is he #$%
@#$ $#@ Grodd means sprout in swedish #$%
@#$ $#@ me still am no understand #$%
@#$ $#@ No, but he would be a great addition. #$%
@#$ $#@ Cold, Flash and Darkseid. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont know which would be main yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ cause superman is a more credible threat for everyone to fight #$%
@#$ $#@ Because that means seeing Batman lose and we cant have any of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Batman: Friends &amp; Foes: The Game #$%
@#$ $#@ Omega Beams. #$%
@#$ $#@ Omega Sanction is a separate thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ DC is still selling well since theyre actually doing things right in the comics department. #$%
@#$ $#@ Modern Aquaman is probably one of his best incarnations yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ he still is the intro just looks cool #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want Lobo back, dont care what the rest are. #$%
@#$ $#@ Since the game isnt coming out on PC. #$%
@#$ $#@ I really want to play, but Im having a hard time justifying getting a PS4 just for Injustice 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Though I guess I could play Bloodborne or some shit too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah there's a big watchmen/DC crossover going on right now #$%
@#$ $#@ Blame Suicide Squad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Deathstroke is thousands of times more interesting than Deadshot, but gotta get that cross platform marketing. #$%
@#$ $#@ DLC maybe #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree shes a stupid choice for a fighting game and her comics are all over the place, but Batwoman art is always so fucking good. #$%
@#$ $#@ desu I think her current run has started strong. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had a dream that we Rorsach was announced and the Question was a skin w/ Jeffery Combs as the voice. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was beautiful and then I awoke to Joker instead. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sounds pretty fantastic if it's true #$%
@#$ $#@ To be fair, that source material in the current year is actual garbage. #$%
@#$ $#@ He looks fine with the right gear. #$%
@#$ $#@ fuck darkseid is so damn cool but i dont like his design in this, this looks way better #$%
@#$ $#@ Those premier options look good, those DLC character options however look pretty shit aside from Constantine and Hellboy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, but Capcom always had special care for Marvel. #$%
@#$ $#@ They had plenty of fuck ups to drawn from during the 3s development, but it came out just fine. #$%
@#$ $#@ This whole deal feels like SFV all over again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn shame too if the claims of the original Versus team being involved are true. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fucking kek #$%
@#$ $#@ Why the fuck do people want Red Hood so bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes cool right? #$%
@#$ $#@ But hes essentially just Batman + Deadshot. #$%
@#$ $#@ He doesn't really bring much to the table in terms of unique gameplay and he's yet another character closer to making Injustice: Batman Among Us a reality. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beast Boy, Constantine, Hellboy, Spawn, and Vixen all sound great though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hawkman and Starfire suffer from the same problem Red Hood does in terms of unique gameplay though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Admittedly they may have something cool for Starfire up their sleeves. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally I just really love his outfit #$%
@#$ $#@ She was always a slut, dumb phone poster. #$%
@#$ $#@ She was a slut for Grayson which was fine but fucking Roy? #$%
@#$ $#@ He is the biggest loser in DC #$%
@#$ $#@ god Black Adam is fucking badass too bad his face looks fucking dumb as hell, if they could have made him look attractive hed be the best in game #$%
@#$ $#@ British teenage girl pls #$%
@#$ $#@ lol that was actually pretty funny but my point still stands, Black Adam looks like a guy that works at 7-11 #$%
@#$ $#@ but he isnt wtf #$%
@#$ $#@ Please help. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love Ed Boons near irrational hate of Hawkman. #$%
@#$ $#@ good hawkman a shit #$%
@#$ $#@ probably so they could be lazy and reuse assets #$%
@#$ $#@ I just want one big guy meme from bane. #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt have to turn into full on movie bane though. #$%
@#$ $#@ this has to be bait #$%
@#$ $#@ obvious bate is fucking obvious. #$%
@#$ $#@ dont bother replying to it, idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is it just me or does Superman have a baby face now? #$%
@#$ $#@ its just you #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just happy that they finally made good fucking characters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I love mirror matches anyway so Im gucci. #$%
@#$ $#@ new 52 if you are brand new to comics and shit #$%
@#$ $#@ Well think of it this way. #$%
@#$ $#@ If it were any other dev we probably wouldnt have gotten him in the first place. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only reason he made it in the first one and MKvsDC is because loves the character. #$%
@#$ $#@ *Boon loves the character #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want attractive models just play Tekken, faces aren't exactly I2 forte #$%
@#$ $#@ Bad witing......plus Batman is the biggest Mary Sue in comics. #$%
@#$ $#@ Better than paying $200 for a game on a very narrow selection that generally only includes fifa and shitty license games, like it is on third world countries. #$%
@#$ $#@ op here. #$%
@#$ $#@ now nier is selling for $2 coz its old. #$%
@#$ $#@ BUT I am no rat. #$%
@#$ $#@ have fun not fucking 2b in the ass and then cumming on her face #$%
@#$ $#@ op here. #$%
@#$ $#@ i just took a shit and WOW you seem 2 know your shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ not only that my friend..... #$%
@#$ $#@ repack torrents are half size of original steam download. #$%
@#$ $#@ andromeda is 30gb less in size #$%
@#$ $#@ OP here. #$%
@#$ $#@ I apologize. #$%
@#$ $#@ The diarrhea from eating nothing but shitty meat and spice has me dehydrated and I dont think properly with my dizzy head. #$%
@#$ $#@ I agree with you, now that Ive thought about it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Many thanks, friend. #$%
@#$ $#@ Man I really wish there was a way to show that I'm quoting someone #$%
@#$ $#@ im just to lazy to google. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ill fap all over that ass, you wait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Sage the thread, idiot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Buy a gun and shoot your brain out, retarded Sony fanboy. #$%
@#$ $#@ /v/ deserves this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Was this supposed to be hard lol? #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not even the best looking PS4 game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Horizon looks better. #$%
@#$ $#@ What really stands out in Uncharted 4 are the animations, nothing comes close on any platform. #$%
@#$ $#@ Prebaked lighting bullshots don't count #$%
@#$ $#@ He said ga- oh youre using stale memes I see. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shut up already, you lost #$%
@#$ $#@ copy that #$%
@#$ $#@ What the hell? #$%
@#$ $#@ How can a 2007 game look so much better? #$%
@#$ $#@ Battlefront and BF1 shit all over every console exclusive #$%
@#$ $#@ those trees on the left look like a ps2 game #$%
@#$ $#@ you're not smart #$%
@#$ $#@ Then the whole of Uncharted 4 doesn't count since it's all pre-baked. #$%
@#$ $#@ Copy that. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont want long necks though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dwarf Fortress #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do people always pick the ugliest levels from U4 when starting threads? #$%
@#$ $#@ Technically not open world, just really large maps. #$%
@#$ $#@ But yeah I agree overall. #$%
@#$ $#@ Crysis isnt open world you dipshit, the entire series is just one really big corridor. #$%
@#$ $#@ False flagging #$%
@#$ $#@ Really impressed by that hand position. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nice going Ivan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its worse than Witcher 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ And Witcher 3 is really bad. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont know why you think I am. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a mod or did you just edit it to look that bad? #$%
@#$ $#@ I was answering the question dummy. #$%
@#$ $#@ delete this right fuicking now #$%
@#$ $#@ Well get there, someday. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I get it know. #$%
@#$ $#@ No we arent. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pic related is 3D geometry rendered in real time in UE4. #$%
@#$ $#@ A couple of games that I know of. #$%
@#$ $#@ Battlefront, BF1, Vanishing of Ethan Carter. #$%
@#$ $#@ None, the anon posted a tech demo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Even Epic dont use it in their own game Paragon. #$%
@#$ $#@ It looks pretty but I had my fill of the series after U3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Talos Principle #$%
@#$ $#@ Damn B:AK was pretty. #$%
@#$ $#@ Looked like an Unreal Engine 4 game, but was made on 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Had some great water too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Copy that but with no long necks #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off shill. #$%
@#$ $#@ No one here is going to pay $130 for a chance to get into the beta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Havent watched past season 2 yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did they really stop them? #$%
@#$ $#@ nice reflections btw #$%
@#$ $#@ What game is that? #$%
@#$ $#@ I feel like ive seen it before. #$%
@#$ $#@ 130 is guaranteed access, is it not? #$%
@#$ $#@ But yeah, shits way too expensive. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure youre the tard here. #$%
@#$ $#@ 2007 definitely looks better #$%
@#$ $#@ no fucking way, this has to be a picture #$%
@#$ $#@ It is doofus #$%
@#$ $#@ Poorfag detected #$%
@#$ $#@ It's modded watch dogs 1 #$%

@#$ $#@ I enjoyed the wolf among us. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never played Sam and Max? #$%
@#$ $#@ But youre living a trash life. #$%
@#$ $#@ No way will the devs allow this to happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ Clem is literally their whole TWD franchise. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gabe is the most annoying character theyve ever produced. #$%
@#$ $#@ This wont happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ IT CAN'T #$%
@#$ $#@ what 4chan app do you use #$%
@#$ $#@ clover you newfag #$%
@#$ $#@ I dropped the game after Episode 2. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it let the baseballs beaner help his big brother maintain a glorious community? #$%
@#$ $#@ Or is it typical Telltale hack writing? #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks for the copypasta. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah idk wtf my parents were thinking either. #$%
@#$ $#@ They took GTA 3, Vice City and the Resident Evil games off me when I was a kid but let me keep games like Manhunt, State of Emergency and Quake 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those are two different places though. #$%
@#$ $#@ BUT FIRST #$%
@#$ $#@ how did we no how to move the character? #$%
@#$ $#@ By having hands #$%
@#$ $#@ breath of the wild is the best game on the nintendo switch hands down #$%
@#$ $#@ Ape Escape has human characters, look it up #$%
@#$ $#@ ive seen cuter #$%

@#$ $#@ God I wish that were me #$%
@#$ $#@ Mei nigga #$%
@#$ $#@ Traps arent shotas. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre their own breed. #$%
@#$ $#@ Some of them, though Gnar is not for lewd. #$%
@#$ $#@ crossdressing boys are still boys #$%
@#$ $#@ Psycho Mantis? #$%
@#$ $#@ It wasnt until you showed up. #$%
@#$ $#@ shota mantis #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit taste desu #$%
@#$ $#@ There are no girls here, just sick older guys wanting to fuck kids. #$%
@#$ $#@ its not illegal if theyre 2D #$%
@#$ $#@ I fucking hate grinding. #$%
@#$ $#@ beaten the game at lvl 86 thanks to the reaper exploit and and the money trick #$%
@#$ $#@ that fight is what made me drop to easy #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard, only time I had trouble so far was during the big bang burger spam the robot boss does at low HP, I was riding on hunger protecting me but Makoto harisen slapped it out of me in the last turn before he went and I had low HP. #$%
@#$ $#@ i grinded 3 times. #$%
@#$ $#@ one so i can get some skills before i went through that cognition locked area in the museum. #$%
@#$ $#@ literally had to grind for shido. #$%
@#$ $#@ and then my final grind was for satan. #$%
@#$ $#@ while i grinded i switched to easy to save time, but i did everything on hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ git gud #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah in hard I regularly have to do more than one all out attack in plenty of fights with the stronger mooks of the dungeon and status conditions regularly have saved my life. #$%
@#$ $#@ no i had no idea how to get or fuse that one persona they wanted, lachesis. #$%
@#$ $#@ so i stopped there. #$%
@#$ $#@ i grinded all the way up to level 92 just to get satan. #$%
@#$ $#@ from like level 70 or around there. #$%
@#$ $#@ right before the final god fight i kept fighting the two shadows in the area right before guarding the chests on each side. #$%
@#$ $#@ fighting them give 10000 exp each nearly every time #$%
@#$ $#@ it fucking sucked because i had no internet whatsoever during my entire playthrough of persona 5. #$%
@#$ $#@ so i did everything as best as i can, including test questions and the fusions. #$%
@#$ $#@ i remember sitting in the velvet room for an hour or two trying to make all these fusions for the twins and it worked out until i got to lachesis which ive never seen in the game #$%
@#$ $#@ reminds me of my early forays into SMT, how horrible #$%
@#$ $#@ i simply made notes of all the demons i could fuse in the fusion screen, even when they were too high for my current level. #$%
@#$ $#@ allowed me to complete the compendium without using the guide. #$%
@#$ $#@ took my two full a4 pages. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thank you all for the help #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont know, those were the easiest bosses for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ the ones i had trouble with were shido, akechi, the pig, and the robots. #$%
@#$ $#@ after i figured the robots were just baton pass the battle i got it, and pig was a no brainer. #$%
@#$ $#@ but shido and akechi were hard as fuck for me #$%
@#$ $#@ Same here. #$%
@#$ $#@ Really satisfying when I left and got that windfall of progress, though. #$%
@#$ $#@ What was hard about madarame? #$%
@#$ $#@ You can almost one shot all the paintings and then madarame himself is even easier. #$%
@#$ $#@ ive been seeing people say he was hard too. #$%
@#$ $#@ i dont know i really didnt find him hard at all on hard mode and beat him the first try #$%
@#$ $#@ I beat him before my team mate could do his sneak thing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Played and beat the first dungeon on hard, and then realized that was miserable as fuck for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ So I played the rest of the game on normal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Might do a fresh start on hard and not pussy out one of these days. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not really, usually you're over the levels of most standard mooks in dungeons but there's always 2-3 strong mooks that are a few levels above you which are always the ones to keep an eye out for and plan around not getting murdered by giving them a 1-more by accident. #$%
@#$ $#@ normal normal Atlus = hard for other games , you can´t break the game until the end #$%
@#$ $#@ An Akihiko run where all you do is go to the gym, drink some protein and get gains #$%
@#$ $#@ Im honestly at a loss over the complaints of madarame. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use swift strike. #$%
@#$ $#@ Beat him first try #$%
@#$ $#@ I didnt even have Matador, I was level 18. #$%
@#$ $#@ Use rampage then, some persona in that level have it already. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what I did since I also didn't have matador yet. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did use Rampage, but man that skill is so unreliable. #$%
@#$ $#@ So many misses or single hits. #$%
@#$ $#@ Merciless is boring since it neuters your money and xp earned. #$%
@#$ $#@ that just sounds like a useless waste of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats the opposite of boring. #$%
@#$ $#@ boring would be too OP. #$%
@#$ $#@ being underleveled puts you in a state of caution since any trash mob will one shot you #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard as I was under average level all the way from Kaneshiro to the end. #$%
@#$ $#@ Never died against any bosses either. #$%
@#$ $#@ The exp part seems like a bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ I cant imagine beating Kamoshida without a way to resist physical. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, putting you underleveled means no demon recruiting until you max the sun link. #$%
@#$ $#@ With MC and ryuji with rampage and two other party members with attack all enemy spells it should be very doable #$%
@#$ $#@ I was level 70 when entering the final dungeon and 75 when taking on the final boss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats means I wont get OP persona to cheese the game which adds challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ if im doing a no slink run maxing the sun link will never happen. #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried. #$%
@#$ $#@ not for izanagi dlc. #$%
@#$ $#@ maybe on the paid ones? #$%
@#$ $#@ you could try starting the game under a different profile so it doesnt detect the dlc under your psn name. #$%
@#$ $#@ I haven't tried that #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre on disc and you already bought them, so no. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just ignore them. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just dont use them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see the issue. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just dont summon them? #$%
@#$ $#@ How would they interfere with anything? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this bait? #$%
@#$ $#@ new game plus is definitely worth it, but why go through the game again the same exact way? #$%
@#$ $#@ thats boring as hell. #$%
@#$ $#@ and its not like if you were one of those dumbasses to complain about using op personas then you just dont use them and make new ones to add to your compendium from the first game. #$%
@#$ $#@ P3 only had money problems because optimal thing to do every night you didnt have a social link was spend thousands of yen at the arcade. #$%
@#$ $#@ They interfere with fusions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Meaning you can obtain them via fusion, which means you can't get the persona you'd get with the same recipe had you not had the DLC persona. #$%
@#$ $#@ ah, I noticed something like that with a fusion calculator. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not that big a deal though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was backed so far into the corner during that bank run and so stubborn about finishing it in one go that I was busting out the Beads for normal encounters. #$%
@#$ $#@ I absolutely love that I felt the need to do that in a turn-based JRPG. #$%
@#$ $#@ same here first time, it was great #$%
@#$ $#@ those spell items are only good if you cant make up damage or need a elemental knock down. #$%
@#$ $#@ This has always existed in other games and I never found a use for them. #$%
@#$ $#@ I assume this is for low level runs I guess #$%
@#$ $#@ I was using them all the way to the end practically, specifically for knockdowns when I couldn't switch out a party member #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre incredibly useful during the Okumura boss fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Getting that third baton pass is satisfying as fuck. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyre useful for baton pass spamming into a big attack when there are strong enemies without weaknesses mixed with weaker enemies with weaknesses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Okumura fight was pretty much the game checking if you finally understood how useful baton passing was since you couldnt all out attack anything. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats why I liked it. #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh yeah and it also pretty much forced you to get the star social link otherwise youd have a much harder time covering most weaknesses unless you stocked a shit ton of elemental items. #$%
@#$ $#@ Those spell items came in major clutch when fighting the last of those supervisor robots for key cards in the burger palace. #$%
@#$ $#@ My chosen party members couldnt hit the little ones for weakness and the boss kept getting healed from the double digits of HP. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just needed that little extra push. #$%
@#$ $#@ That fight made me realize the value of having a single Persona with a bunch of different elements as opposed to having a whole separate Persona for each individual element like how I played P3 and P4. #$%
@#$ $#@ Too many magical damage types in this game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Any way of getting Auto-mataru, Auto-Makaru, and Auto-Masuku on a single persona? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im thinking of trying to make one just for the sole purpose of serving as the opener of any fight. #$%
@#$ $#@ Confidant ranks is a bond you dont have to be anywhere to feel like the bond has grown. #$%
@#$ $#@ Morgana knows because of end game plot details. #$%
@#$ $#@ It would fallen apart by some other means if it hadnt been the pancakes, I mean Goros acting is so atrocious he didnt even manage to make Shido trust him and was going to get disposed of before he could enact his master plan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Abuse the hell out of the sacrifice mechanic passing down skills. #$%
@#$ $#@ Save, then sacrifice until it passes down the skill you want. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want more than one skill, you can get around the typical limit of one sacrifice per day by registering in the compendium, dismissing the Persona, and then summoning it back. #$%
@#$ $#@ All that limits you is money. #$%
@#$ $#@ hard mode doesnt have an exp gimp though. #$%
@#$ $#@ merciless does. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its called hard mode dumbass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Merciless is the only difficulty that reduces exp and currency gain. #$%
@#$ $#@ daily reminder that if you didn't play this game on at least hard on the entire way through, you are literally trash at vidya #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard is 0.8x exp. #$%
@#$ $#@ that's merciless #$%
@#$ $#@ I personally found it extremely frustrating before i decided to just let go #$%
@#$ $#@ Yep, its a bit tiring to be honest, usually I see deadlines as the end of fun time and the beginning of endless 4 minute long cutscenes with going to bed without doing anything other than feeding my plant every day. #$%
@#$ $#@ This thread has to be bait. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally how do you have trouble in a Persona game? #$%
@#$ $#@ This is the easiest Persona game by far and OP is youre having trouble I would love to see you play P1 Snow Queen Quest, P3 or god forbid Nocturne. #$%
@#$ $#@ That's hard look it up #$%
@#$ $#@ I found P3 easier. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even chance Tactics. #$%
@#$ $#@ no sites says hard gimps the exp. #$%
@#$ $#@ youre looking at merciless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt find the beginning any harder than any other Megaten game. #$%
@#$ $#@ Naraku felt a lot more threatening. #$%
@#$ $#@ why don't you two faggots just test it already, it would take you literally less than 10 minutes #$%
@#$ $#@ just fucking use remote play you retard #$%
@#$ $#@ nigger im at work. #$%
@#$ $#@ Akechi is the best boy. #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm shitposting from work #$%
@#$ $#@ What goalposts? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not that anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ I did die a few times on that one but I found it much easier once I used Tarunda on him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Based it off the damage decrease. #$%
@#$ $#@ Merciless is less than half. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fuck off fatefag #$%
@#$ $#@ Just got Haru and so far it's not as punishing as mainline, I didn't have to stop and fuse to beat any boss, just using what I have at hand is enough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wasnt playing on Merciless basically just more grinding, and not actually more difficult? #$%
@#$ $#@ They wanted to make Almighty skills useful for once. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything that nulls/repel physical attacks. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's an embarasssing number of enemies that don't use magic. #$%
@#$ $#@ Rolling in dosh. #$%
@#$ $#@ They already were. #$%
@#$ $#@ In so far as they ignore any and all resistences. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just so happens that is a trait of limited use on most non gimmick bosses. #$%
@#$ $#@ FUCK KOREY #$%
@#$ $#@ Not even close to the bullshit Mementos Depths was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Holy shit that part was unapologetic in fucking you over. #$%
@#$ $#@ When nobody has multi-target phys skills, and everybody gets 1-shotted with no way to cover weaknesses, you would have to rely on perfect RNG to get through on merciless at that low of a level. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because your personas and their skills matter much more than level. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's even easier in this game since your character isn't locked into a specific build like other Megaten games. #$%
@#$ $#@ its a level 25 persona dumbass with a ridiculous early physical spell. #$%
@#$ $#@ literally cheating #$%
@#$ $#@ nah you get pretty cucked and everybody still cheers for him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Are you dumb? #$%
@#$ $#@ Direct commands. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you reached the air locks? #$%
@#$ $#@ If youre having a hard time already, Okumura is going to kick your ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Still not sure how I beat him first try. #$%
@#$ $#@ Didnt even know about his gimmick. #$%
@#$ $#@ If Tactics were the same as they were in Persona 3, then I could see using them as sort of an extra challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ But theyre completely useless in 4 and 5 so just use Direct commands. #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't really consider extra grinding a difficulty increase, it's just a tedium increase. #$%
@#$ $#@ It just pads the game out. #$%
@#$ $#@ 4th dungeons the pyramid, I think Okumura is the 5th. #$%
@#$ $#@ I just can't bring myself to play if there's no real possibility of failure. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id feel like I had no right to ever discuss the game unless I beat it at least on easy. #$%
@#$ $#@ please respond #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre right. #$%
@#$ $#@ I should go to sleep. #$%
@#$ $#@ Started on normal, switched to hard at end of 4th dungeon, now doing a merciless Arsene only run. #$%
@#$ $#@ Almighty is bad unless its tied to a physical skill like Nocturne had. #$%
@#$ $#@ It has way to high MP cost with little power. #$%
@#$ $#@ Combats shit anyway, why make it last longer with a higher dificulty? #$%
@#$ $#@ You could just use something that has null or repel phys #$%
@#$ $#@ grinding tells you that you're stuck and can't progress. #$%
@#$ $#@ youre already admitting the game is hard when you do that. #$%
@#$ $#@ in this case merciless is harder than hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ go figure #$%
@#$ $#@ Antichthon was good. #$%
@#$ $#@ Having an aoe attack with added debilitate was useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Youre an absolute piece of shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get off this board abd killy yourself. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its alright in Apocalypse because affinities. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only if you maxed them out, and only the ailment recovery one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Only some of their abilities except Goro. #$%
@#$ $#@ You also need to talk to them on 3/20. #$%
@#$ $#@ Titania is pretty good #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah like I said it's tied to something and doesn't have a insane MP cost. #$%
@#$ $#@ The instant death aliment ones are good and specific ones like Freikugel. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just shit like Megidolaon is a useless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Merciless is literally, LITERALLY easier than hard #$%
@#$ $#@ hard, too much grinding in merciless #$%
@#$ $#@ Not for bosses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Normal first playthrough. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard on NG+. #$%
@#$ $#@ Gigantic faggot here, I feel completely justified in my actions. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow, it's almost as if it sounds like the way a good JRPG should be played #$%
@#$ $#@ levels can determine what persona and skills you can access. #$%
@#$ $#@ grinding to get these persona or skills makes the game easier. #$%
@#$ $#@ pretty brutal when you can't crit bosses but can crit you for 3x dmg and you're underleved so it scales hard #$%
@#$ $#@ somebody pls send footage of someone beating madarame on merciless at lv 13 with no dlc crutches #$%
@#$ $#@ if there is no such video. #$%
@#$ $#@ I plan on doing that on a fresh save. #$%
@#$ $#@ possibly even lower level than that #$%
@#$ $#@ I tried so hard to do it, 9 games worth of Megaten experience didnt help at all. #$%
@#$ $#@ 20-30 or so tries in I caved and grinded to lv16, then beat it within a couple attempts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Get off thiis board casual trash #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats the one reason I started on Hard, personally. #$%
@#$ $#@ I had memories of the start of SMTIV Hard, I didnt want to go through that again. #$%
@#$ $#@ Funny you say that, SMTIV was my first megaten game and I started on the hardest difficulty they allow you. #$%
@#$ $#@ Naraku, although it was tough, was shitloads of fun in how unforgiving it was. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fusing a superior demon for minotaur was a great early challenge #$%
@#$ $#@ Im actually doing a self imposed challenge. #$%
@#$ $#@ mandatory battles on merciless no dlc. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think the only way for me to beat that boss is persona level hopping. #$%
@#$ $#@ basically feed persona through compendium. #$%
@#$ $#@ the problem is the money which Ill be farming nothing but treasure in mementos until the end of time. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was just frustrating for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I was pretty low level for Minotaur, maybe about 11 or 12 and it's infuriating to lose even though he's almost dead just because of a single crit, even after your assloads of Sukukaja buffs, while Medusa was worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ It gets way easier after the start but it was ridiculous before then. #$%
@#$ $#@ you're not going to feel the effect of merciless until you become underleved which is the whole point of the difficulty #$%
@#$ $#@ Merciless gimps your money and xp to 40% I believe, but crits/weaks/technicals are tripled in damage for both sides. #$%
@#$ $#@ It's kind of a completely different way to play, I wouldn't really recommend switching to it midgame. #$%
@#$ $#@ Just my opinion #$%
@#$ $#@ Can you explain? #$%
@#$ $#@ Oh, so its not DMD but more like gimmicky difficulty? #$%
@#$ $#@ Well then, Ill continue on hard. #$%
@#$ $#@ Props, thats the gambit I was originally going with. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got about halfway through once, but it took dozens of tries to even get that far. #$%
@#$ $#@ If the boss hits a weakness once, you're just fucked because you've lost 2 party members and you have to spend all your turns getting them back up. #$%
@#$ $#@ Eventually I just gave up because doing it without AOE phys skills is a death wish #$%
@#$ $#@ there is a hidden damage mechanic where the greater the level difference the damage scales. #$%
@#$ $#@ like you could have the same stats and same equipment at level 5 or 10 but if the enemy is level 15 youre going to get fucked more in the ass at level 5 than on 10. #$%
@#$ $#@ merciless forces you to be in underleved state constantly #$%
@#$ $#@ It is a lot harder, but mainly just because you get less XP. #$%
@#$ $#@ So the effect is kinda diminished if you start halfway through #$%
@#$ $#@ You get less than half experience as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ That will make you underleveled all the time which limits your number of persona you can use and. #$%
@#$ $#@ But that is also encourages you play strategically and make good use of persona resistances and skill to the max instead of randomly fusing the highest persona you can get. #$%
@#$ $#@ there is a reason why he turned himself in instantly after you finished his dungeon #$%
@#$ $#@ Hard first time, not too bad aside from dying once on the Madarame boss because of weakness exploit. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ng+ was easy because I just wanted to do confidants, planning a new game in merciless later. #$%
@#$ $#@ It makes me wonder how bullshit itll be to try to beat the Reaper and twins without grind. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont know if I should even bother trying. #$%
@#$ $#@ if you found a way then upload that to youtube. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think anyone is going to beat that for awhile. #$%
@#$ $#@ I think if I had more takemedics the 100hp-all one I probably could have done it with some more tries. #$%
@#$ $#@ The fact that I ran out by the time I wiped the paintings once was pretty much the last nail in the coffin. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got so fucking fed up, I just swapped to hard so I could quickly grind out to lv16 while on 99% security. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can never fucking tell with rpgs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Shit genre tbqh. #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty much any persona is game breaking when you give it the bullshit passives it needs. #$%
@#$ $#@ Breaking the game is the fun part. #$%
@#$ $#@ All these Haru x Mako pictures make me really happy inside #$%
@#$ $#@ I don't care about the shipping aspect, but cute Harus make me happy #$%
@#$ $#@ Which confidant? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just got futaba #$%
@#$ $#@ But you still have 3 turns left to finish up after an all out attack? #$%
@#$ $#@ And an all out attack forces all the enemies to stand up so you can start chaining all over again? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see how what you described is any better than an all out attack. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its not as if he needs to play anything else. #$%
@#$ $#@ On merciless the multiplier is higher on crits/weaknesses. #$%
@#$ $#@ Way stronger doing 2x crits than a crit + AOA #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, that makes sense. #$%
@#$ $#@ Seems a lot less reliable with baseline crit rate though, does critting get a lot more reliable later in the game? #$%
@#$ $#@ I think baton pass increases atk each time you use it in a row. #$%
@#$ $#@ breaks are useless #$%
@#$ $#@ Normal for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont like extended difficulty which essentially boils down to waste more of my time. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont worry Safe mode was designed for idiot like you, thank you for your purchase -Atlus. #$%
@#$ $#@ Where the hell are my Ann x Siho lesbian doujins, Japan? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'm replaying a fresh file on Hard and it's definitely way better. #$%
@#$ $#@ Normal was easy as fuck, but Im wondering if that wasnt because Ive memorized most of the demon weaknesses from other SMT games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yoshida / Sun. #$%
@#$ $#@ The politican. #$%
@#$ $#@ Also, the reporter bitch. #$%
@#$ $#@ how does this look so much better than yooka-laylee? #$%
@#$ $#@ kirby has good unused games/content #$%

@#$ $#@ Andre was originally Gwyn's son #$%
@#$ $#@ This is used in the multiplayer if I recall correctly. #$%
@#$ $#@ André was supposed to be the firstborn son #$%
@#$ $#@ Which is Gwyn's son #$%
@#$ $#@ being the firstborn son is more important than just being a son #$%
@#$ $#@ When I say Gwyn's son it's obviously implied that I mean the firstborn in particular #$%
@#$ $#@ You got btfo, accept it bitch #$%
@#$ $#@ It does? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's pretty neat #$%
@#$ $#@ DO NOT bully my wife #$%
@#$ $#@ Welp, at least its about Luka... #$%
@#$ $#@ Luka is SUCH a loser. #$%
@#$ $#@ Arent you ashamed of being around someone like her? #$%
@#$ $#@ Long live Yukari #$%
@#$ $#@ why not everyone? #$%
@#$ $#@ Fine, but Yukari gets to wear the crown at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Everyone gets a tiara. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fine, but Yukari gets one with a bunny on it. #$%
@#$ $#@ That sounds good. #$%
@#$ $#@ very 30s #$%
@#$ $#@ Feeling any better? #$%
@#$ $#@ /mm/ running out of things to talk about has been a running issue for over 2 years now. #$%

@#$ $#@ Since this is /v/ and people are not posting about the video games would that mean that despite praising the different vocaloids and saying how cute they are, etc., that its off topic just as much as lewdposting since this is a video games board? #$%

@#$ $#@ That's how Labour Day works here also #$%
@#$ $#@ why did they unlist them? #$%
@#$ $#@ You're right, these threads shouldn't be allowed unless there's new content to discuss #$%

@#$ $#@ No dummy, its the DYE is cast, because they would be painted as traitors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its the best Total War.I love picking Gaul and just capturing Roman cities, destroying all the infrastructure they have then leaving the city to rebels.So much fun. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its like you never played the campaign for more than 6 hours #$%
@#$ $#@ Has a great mod, Europe barbaroum that is a clean and a near perfect design. #$%
@#$ $#@ Because games require significant technical knowledge compared to other software, but working conditions are shit. #$%

@#$ $#@ Warhammer is the only game from that list that people actually play, LMAO. #$%

@#$ $#@ What did reviewers even dislike about it? #$%
@#$ $#@ You mean Steam reviewers? #$%
@#$ $#@ The DLC pricing. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont read gaming journalist drivel, but, apparently, it has 86% on Metacritic. #$%
@#$ $#@ It is sexist and ableist. #$%
@#$ $#@ It taught me to murder the populace of unhappy cities and that slavery is always preferable to conversion. #$%
@#$ $#@ No chinese translation #$%
@#$ $#@ It turned out Cherche really was just a meme, but I was honestly spooked by that at first #$%
@#$ $#@ Why drag back? #$%
@#$ $#@ Too be fair you don't really want her fighting in the first place #$%
@#$ $#@ If you dont really want her fighting in the first place, then why bother with her? #$%

@#$ $#@ Vantage and.... #$%
@#$ $#@ thats it. #$%

@#$ $#@ I've been trying to find something with Darting blow #$%
@#$ $#@ I just use Darting+Desperation with my Ninan #$%
@#$ $#@ Put Fury on her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Fury is a really good choice on support characters who dont get into combat all that much. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hinata gets it at 4* #$%
@#$ $#@ I rolled 7 3* Stahls going for Ike. #$%
@#$ $#@ He isnt even useful for SI. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never want to see his shitty face again. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wasnt sure if I wanted desperation or swordbreaker. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it work the exact same as Iceberg, but with ATK instead of RES? #$%
@#$ $#@ I thought it was 30 percent of the damage dealt. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've been searching for things with Death blow, but unfortunately, no dice #$%

@#$ $#@ Speed is everything #$%
@#$ $#@ Corrin actually has really solid stats, and Yato is an interesting toy. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes no Ryoma or Lucina, but skill inheritance can make him pretty strong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes terrible husbando material though. #$%
@#$ $#@ does it work with things like spurs and death blow bonus? #$%
@#$ $#@ Sophia gets fortify res at 4*. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you run a blade tome user, that is useful. #$%
@#$ $#@ Somehow the Speed +1 is the funniest part. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ah, cool. #$%
@#$ $#@ Guess Ill get him Draconic Aura. #$%
@#$ $#@ Good thing SP gain is doubled. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thar she blows! #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont think that spurs count for skills but it stacks with deathblow, assuming that you are attacking. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is this possible? #$%
@#$ $#@ I just rolled a 5 star Eldigan and Abel, so Id like a brief redpill dosage on cavmemes. #$%
@#$ $#@ fury and quick riposte #$%

@#$ $#@ Nevermind on D. #$%
@#$ $#@ Aura then. #$%
@#$ $#@ I like using Iceberg over Moonbow because of guaranteed damage rather than variable damage. #$%
@#$ $#@ Plus when I get my full cav team going hell be getting RES and ATK buffs for fuckhuge damage. #$%
@#$ $#@ I have a Palla that I can feed, just need more sp. #$%
@#$ $#@ What seal should I use though? #$%
@#$ $#@ Who says that you need be 5* to use + weapons? #$%
@#$ $#@ you can feed a 5 star to a 1 star. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anything is possible with enough feathers and SP #$%
@#$ $#@ I see +HP Taco often enough in the Arena to be honest. #$%
@#$ $#@ But yeah, no +def. #$%
@#$ $#@ Most robins I see are +speed anyway. #$%
@#$ $#@ Actually wait, he survives with +Attack too as long as he has the +hp seal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wait what. #$%
@#$ $#@ When she gets a banner with Meta Knight, Saber, and Demifiend #$%
@#$ $#@ Post Sigurd #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont have any. #$%
@#$ $#@ Look, I know Catria is defensive, but Carrot Lance? #$%
@#$ $#@ I fed her a Spring Xander since he was shit along with the fact I grinded a ton of SP of this 2x event thats going on for the next few days. #$%
@#$ $#@ All in all, it was for shits and giggles. #$%
@#$ $#@ I see, #$%
@#$ $#@ Funnily enough, this game has VAs whove done Gundam stuff in both languages. #$%
@#$ $#@ I never watched Gundam in English, who are the JP VAs? #$%
@#$ $#@ Id like to hope Char clones would be fliers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Koyasu voices Niles. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is Barte really that good if you put effort into him? #$%
@#$ $#@ That is pretty all right. #$%
@#$ $#@ anyone is decent when you put that much effort into them #$%
@#$ $#@ He was good enough to fuck Karla, so probably. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thered need to be Capcom copyrights if that were the case. #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally just leave him as is but replace Luna with draconic aura or bonfire depending on IVs and whatever C skill you want for the rest of your team. #$%
@#$ $#@ Karla fucked him. #$%
@#$ $#@ Tiki to pass to loli tiki is probably the best of those, I'm sure you'll get a shana to pass desperation sometime and Tharja will be the focus in the upcoming gauntlet #$%
@#$ $#@ Longer CD skills are better for slow units? #$%
@#$ $#@ And the No Delegates version for those who want it. #$%
@#$ $#@ At least Effie is a good unit. #$%
@#$ $#@ I gave her bowbreaker because I needed a tacomeme killer #$%
@#$ $#@ Abel is an extremely effective red remover with his Swordbreaker. #$%
@#$ $#@ bait a red into attacking him and watch it take 33x2 damage. #$%
@#$ $#@ with +ATK, he should also be strong enough to pick off blue and even green mages in one round. #$%
@#$ $#@ having him rush in to 22x2 a Nino saved my ass more times than i can count #$%
@#$ $#@ Dunno about Abel, but you basically got the one of the two best boons for Cordy and one of the two worst banes for her. #$%
@#$ $#@ Slap Darting Blow or Life and Death 3 + Drag back to rev up that Quadelia. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes pretty as hell at least. #$%
@#$ $#@ Does wanting to kiss him make me gay? #$%
@#$ $#@ Are all pegasus riders sluts? #$%
@#$ $#@ I got one, too, but I think he was +Spd-Res. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont even care, he can wreck asses til I get a better one. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, thats pretty gay dude. #$%
@#$ $#@ His starting kit is bullshit optimized, at the very least. #$%
@#$ $#@ In terms of stat line hes essentially on par with Jeorge and Takumi. #$%
@#$ $#@ Hes great if you can keep him out of melee and bow range. #$%
@#$ $#@ He counters most mages really hard and can ORKO most units in general when initiating. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theres some battles where I find him more effective than Takumi. #$%
@#$ $#@ So hes really good? #$%
@#$ $#@ Is that what bullshit optimized means? #$%
@#$ $#@ His skills are the only good reason to roll colorless. #$%
@#$ $#@ Ive seen a Takumi with Pass 3. #$%
@#$ $#@ Brave Bow Death Blow pre inheritance meant that he nuked a lot of fucking shit on player phase, the proc skill was just the icing on the cake. #$%
@#$ $#@ Colorless in general has depreciated in value now, but hes still a solid unit and you can get some good mileage out of him. #$%
@#$ $#@ He works for me. #$%
@#$ $#@ He's not as good as Taco, but like hell I'm ever going to roll colorless again because fuck getting healers. #$%
@#$ $#@ Stop sniping #$%
@#$ $#@ Doesnt answer the question. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im just unlucky with red rolls to not have Hinata. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've rolled basically every blue orb and still don't have Shanna either. #$%
@#$ $#@ How long would it take to grow your hair that long? #$%
@#$ $#@ Tomorrow is another day anon,you will still get the chance to summon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Dont give up. #$%
@#$ $#@ They are playing a mind game with you,making you want to put money in the game while at the same time giving you enough orbs to get whatever you want for free. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a waiting game #$%
@#$ $#@ Itll be back. #$%
@#$ $#@ And theyll undoubtedly add other, probably more powerful seals as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ you just get SP, both need to be 5 star to get 5+ #$%
@#$ $#@ If you don't fuse the same rarity you only get SP I believe but no stats up #$%
@#$ $#@ A new map I guess? #$%
@#$ $#@ That's what you get for not planning things ahead, I bet your life is miserable too #$%
@#$ $#@ Id probably merge them. #$%
@#$ $#@ You'll end up with a better unit and it'll boost your arena score as well. #$%
@#$ $#@ the fuck is the point of plussing 4* and below then? #$%
@#$ $#@ I'd rather get a footjob from her #$%
@#$ $#@ Im jelly. #$%
@#$ $#@ I've got the same team in the works but I can't fucking get Leo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Id fuck her. #$%
@#$ $#@ The only closeted homosexuals here are the people that beat off to traps and mtf. #$%
@#$ $#@ Nah, you didn't really play the game or you're too miserable for your opinion to matter #$%
@#$ $#@ both wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ So just play Ninja Gaiden. #$%
@#$ $#@ I wonder whos behind this post. #$%
@#$ $#@ Kamiya had a bit of this too in DMC1. #$%
@#$ $#@ Alastor/Force Edge/Sparda all basically have the same moveset with only a few minor differences. #$%
@#$ $#@ I can say the same for DMC though. #$%
@#$ $#@ I got a step further and post actually gameplay of pros doing the same shit over and over in different videos from the last video. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC3s options are drastically different though. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC4's a bit all over the place #$%
@#$ $#@ Ninja Gaiden it's in the OP ffs #$%
@#$ $#@ anyone have the ninja gaiden 2 webm from the first level on master ninja mode? #$%
@#$ $#@ think the players name was gladiator something. #$%
@#$ $#@ thats not the point. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC combos videos are all the same. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same dail up starters and enders. #$%
@#$ $#@ play Nioh #$%
@#$ $#@ Nobody plays DMC3. #$%
@#$ $#@ All I hear about is DMC4 and that game is the same dial up combo shit. #$%
@#$ $#@ DMC3 is literally button mashing, just not dumb button mashing except on Turbo, it's possible to break your hand trying to mash out those moves without buffering on Turbo #$%
@#$ $#@ Platinum isnt required for costumes only for jeanne as a playable character. #$%
@#$ $#@ Bayonetta 2 is better though. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon want milkies. #$%
@#$ $#@ how much better? #$%
@#$ $#@ i got up to the part in the first one where youre speeding down the highway or some shit on a motorcycle before i said fuck it and just stopped playing. #$%
@#$ $#@ jesus that looks ridiculous #$%
@#$ $#@ Cosplayers did it best. #$%
@#$ $#@ Black has shit combat #$%
@#$ $#@ And you were born from your mother's anus after she shoved a rug used to clean up the world's biggest bukkake party up her ass. #$%
@#$ $#@ Remember; the people saying that stuff suck at the game and have no idea what theyre talking about. #$%
@#$ $#@ My favorite is Jam Session from DMC3 and that god like assist in MvC3, but After Burner Kick is rad #$%
@#$ $#@ Yes man kablaam is better #$%
@#$ $#@ ABK is repetitive. #$%
@#$ $#@ I try not to use it as much as possible. #$%
@#$ $#@ No, you just have shit taste, ninja dog. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats all most games in this shitty genre have #$%
@#$ $#@ Bayo 1 originally only had English VA, even in the Japanese release. #$%
@#$ $#@ It was only until it was rereleased with Bayo 2 that it received a Japanese dub. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thats /v/ showing its true colors. #$%
@#$ $#@ Anon you're actually embarrassing yourself by talking about things you don't understand and generalizing so fucking hard to prove your non-existent point over no evidence. #$%
@#$ $#@ For your own sake you shouldnt post about this topic. #$%
@#$ $#@ This so hard #$%
@#$ $#@ It appears that you guys dont have an agreed definition on the term button mashing. #$%
@#$ $#@ Personally I never found it sufficiently descriptive for a hobby that is almost entirely about pressing buttons. #$%
@#$ $#@ Have you played Resident Evil you underage fuccboi? #$%
@#$ $#@ RANDOMLY during cutscenes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Wow theyre different every playthrough? #$%
@#$ $#@ Maybe youre just a shitter who expects to get a perfect score first time you play, because if you play any segment more than once to run for score you will KNOW where those 4 QTEs over the whole game are at and never fail them again. #$%
@#$ $#@ No game has good qtes either, theyre just an unnecessary nuisance that dont benefit the games in any way. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its just a test of your reflexes. #$%
@#$ $#@ How is that a bad thing for a video game? #$%
@#$ $#@ skipped cutscenes because idgaf about the plot. #$%
@#$ $#@ Same for games like NG or DMC #$%
@#$ $#@ This is your own fault then. #$%
@#$ $#@ Wonderful 101 my man #$%
@#$ $#@ Because its a boring test since it has 0 depth, does not mesh with any of the main mechanics and becomes trivial after you encounter it once. #$%
@#$ $#@ Again, it's just a nuisance that doesn't add anything to the games. #$%
@#$ $#@ Yeah, everyone of the main serie and then some: their QTE were shitty too. #$%
@#$ $#@ Your point? #$%
@#$ $#@ I never used lock-on because of that. #$%
@#$ $#@ Did the worst guy from rlm actually say that? #$%
@#$ $#@ Previously recorded was a mistake. #$%
@#$ $#@ So Best Friends, Game Grumps, and Jontron threads are a okay but Pre recorded is not? #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont see how anyone could ever watch them, Rich and Auschwitz have no entertainment value. #$%
@#$ $#@ This is accurate #$%
@#$ $#@ Arent they incredibly fucking bitter to their fanbase? #$%
@#$ $#@ I heard that during the Bersek Stream he skipped the cutscnes and kept going "fuck anime fans" for no reason #$%
@#$ $#@ Literally the only funny thing he's ever done on RLM #$%
@#$ $#@ HE GOT BLOWN UP ON ALDERAAN #$%
@#$ $#@ I FUCKING LOVE STAR WARS #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not sure Rich Minerski has been in any other Half in the Bag episodes. #$%
@#$ $#@ Honestly, if stealing a car was as easy and victimless as digital piracy, Id do it. #$%
@#$ $#@ AIDSMoby did nothing wrong. #$%
@#$ $#@ Multiplayer access revocation is pretty common. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you want to mess with a single-player game using CheatEngine or mod it you have no guarantee you wont receive a VAC ban for this. #$%
@#$ $#@ Valve support actually tell you that, try asking them if you dont believe me. #$%
@#$ $#@ He had a pretty great anecdote about sneaking in to a football event or whatever with his friends while masquerading as the press. #$%
@#$ $#@ No matter what he says its not going to change a fucking thing, nobody is going to listen to that and have an epiphany. #$%
@#$ $#@ Uncharted 4 was a terrible moviegame with nice graphics, get over it. #$%
@#$ $#@ I only watch them when Susan is on. #$%
@#$ $#@ That is 100 percent legal. #$%
@#$ $#@ or wait a day and pirate it for FREE #$%
@#$ $#@ Pretty sure all piracy is technically legal, it's the actual distributing and cracking that's illegal. #$%
@#$ $#@ I dont pirate games unless pricks make it difficult for me to buy them. #$%
@#$ $#@ If they wanted my money they shouldnt have made it so hard for me to give it to them. #$%
@#$ $#@ There's a reason he's not on nerdcrew. #$%
@#$ $#@ Not so. #$%
@#$ $#@ If you own a license to a game, you can install it through whatever means you wish boyo. #$%
@#$ $#@ Generally I agree, although I did enjoy Westworld. #$%
@#$ $#@ Game of Thrones has been shit since S3 and has only gotten worse. #$%
@#$ $#@ actually from what i remember, despite what videogame companies will tell you, the only part that's truly illegal is if you're selling the copies #$%
@#$ $#@ God I hate these cunts. #$%
@#$ $#@ Why do they come in and ruin Half in the Bag episodes? #$%
@#$ $#@ Rich is the worst, most unfunny, obnoxious person I could ever imagine and I just hate watching him. #$%
@#$ $#@ First season of true detective was stellar. #$%
@#$ $#@ Theyve always shat on anime. #$%
@#$ $#@ no /pol/ to keep the left in line. #$%
@#$ $#@ Is this a joke or do you not know what trinity means? #$%
@#$ $#@ Im legitimately asking, not trying to take the piss. #$%
@#$ $#@ Welcome to 4chan. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a newfag meme. #$%
@#$ $#@ Thanks, champ. #$%
@#$ $#@ Im not your champ, pal. #$%
@#$ $#@ Its a joke anon. #$%
@#$ $#@ Been around for a short while were someone posts 4 games and says trinity to get replies. #$%
@#$ $#@ Now off I go to see "&gt;What did shemale mean by this?" #$%
@#$ $#@ Does it count if I do have a Reddit account, but I only use it for porn subs? #$%
@#$ $#@ There are no "wars", everyone here just wants leddit gone. #$%
